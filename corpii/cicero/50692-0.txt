INTRODUCTION


This second volume of Cicero's _Letters to Atticus_ embraces one of the
most important epochs in Roman history, the fall of the Republic in
the struggle between Pompey and Caesar. The storm which had long been
brewing broke just as Cicero returned from Cilicia over the question
of Caesar's resignation of office. By the agreement made in 56 B.C.
Caesar's governorship of Gaul was renewed for five years and he was
then to be re-elected to the consulship in 48 B.C. As the renewal dated
from March 1, 54 B.C., his term of office would naturally expire on
March 1, 49 B.C.: but according to the rule in vogue at the time of the
reappointment he would not be superseded until Jan. 1, 48 B.C., the
date on which he would enter on the consulship. He would therefore hold
office continually, and his enemies, the Senatorial party, would have
no chance of bringing a prosecution against him, which might be fatal
to his career. But in 52 B.C. they had induced Pompey to bring forward
a new law by which ex-magistrates did not proceed to a province as soon
as their office ended but after an interval of five years. Consequently
for the next five years special appointments had to be made by the
Senate--for example Cicero's appointment to Cilicia--and, as they could
be made at any time, it would be perfectly easy to supersede Caesar
on March 1, 49, and secure his prosecution, condemnation and downfall
before he could enter on the consulship.

Another new law of Pompey's insisted on the personal attendance of
candidates for office, from which Caesar had previously obtained
special exemption. On the remonstrance of Caesar's friends Pompey had
inserted a clause allowing such special exemptions to stand: but this
clause was never properly passed. This again was designed to ensure
Caesar's presence in Rome, with a view to his prosecution.

During the next two years the question of his resignation was
continually coming up in the House, but no definite conclusion
was reached, owing largely to Curio's spirited attacks on all the
Senatorial party's proposals. That party however was ready to catch at
any trifle to pick a quarrel with Caesar: and they found an opportunity
when in Sept. 50 B.C. Caesar decided to send the 13th legion into
Cisalpine Gaul to replace the 15th, which he had had to surrender,
nominally for the war in Syria, though actually the legion was kept
in Italy. A report was circulated that he was sending four legions to
Placentia with hostile intentions. The report was disproved by Curio:
but, though the majority of the Senate supported the opposition, and
refused to declare Caesar a public enemy, Marcellus, the consul, took
upon himself to appoint Pompey to the command over two legions with
authority to raise more against Caesar. On his return to Cisalpine
Gaul in November, Caesar ignored this illegal commission and privately
offered to give up Transalpine Gaul on March 1, if allowed to keep
Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum with two legions or even Illyricum with
one. It was at this juncture that Cicero returned to Italy, and he
seems to have spoken in favour of accepting this proposal, though
shocked at Caesar's "impudence" in making it. But neither Pompey nor
the Senatorial party took it seriously, and Caesar was forced to send
an ultimatum stating that he would resign only if Pompey did the same.
The Senate replied that, if he did not resign, he would be declared
a public enemy: and, when their motion to that effect was vetoed by
Antony and Cassius, the latter met with the same treatment and had to
flee to Caesar in company with Curio.

On hearing their report Caesar took the first step in the war by
crossing the Rubicon. His march southward was so quickly executed that
Pompey and the consuls evacuated Rome. Negotiations for peace failed.
Domitius with eighteen cohorts at Corfinium was taken prisoner, and
Pompey retreated to Brundisium on his way to Greece. Hurrying after
him Caesar blockaded the town: but Pompey succeeded in effecting
his escape. Meantime Cicero was exhibiting the weakest side of his
character. At the first outbreak he offered to go with Pompey: but he
was given the command of Capua and the Campanian coast. This command he
resigned in a few days: later he set out to join Pompey at Brundisium,
but retreated for fear of capture: and thereafter for months he
remained at Formiae shilly-shallying and writing querulous letters to
Atticus for advice. However, when he met Caesar on his return from
Brundisium to Rome, he had sufficient courage to refuse to take a seat
in the House and support his demands.

Caesar's stay in Rome was short and marked only by his seizure of the
public treasury and the appointment of his friends Lepidus and Antony
as prefect of the city and military commander respectively. Then he
hastened to Spain, where, after nearly meeting with a disaster, he
defeated the five legions under Afranius and Petreius at Ilerda, and
gained the whole peninsula. While the issue was still uncertain
in Spain, and indeed things looked unfavourable to Caesar, Cicero
screwed up his courage and joined Pompey in Epirus. Meantime Sardinia
was occupied by Caesar's adjutant P. Valerius and Sicily gave way to
Curio. The latter passed on to Africa, where after some success he met
with defeat and death at the hands of Juba. It was not till January
48 B.C. that Caesar effected a landing in Epirus, where he proceeded
to surround Pompey's camp near Dyrrachium: but his lines were broken
through and he sustained a slight defeat. He retired towards Thessaly
and there in August won a decisive victory over Pompey at Pharsalus.
Pompey fled to Cyprus and thence to Egypt, there to meet his death. The
rest of the party split up, some going to Africa to carry on the war,
others to Greece and Asia to make terms for themselves with Caesar.
Cicero after a violent quarrel with his brother at Patrae returned to
Brundisium, and there spent many miserable months wondering what his
fate would be when Caesar returned. His misfortunes were increased by
a rupture with his wife Terentia, and the unfaithfulness and general
misconduct of his son-in-law Dolabella, which forced him to procure a
divorce for Tullia. And there this volume leaves him, moaning.

scis me Athenas venisse pr. Idus Octobres, e navi egressum in Piraeum
tuas ab Acasto nostro litteras accepisse, conturbatum, quod cum febre
Romam venisses, bono tamen animo esse coepisse, quod Acastus ea, quae
vellem, de allevato corpore tuo nuntiaret, cohorruisse autem me eo[1]
quod tuae litterae de legionibus Caesaris adferrent, et egisse tecum,

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Athens, Oct. 16_, B.C. _50_]


I did give L. Saufeius a letter, one for you alone, because, though I
had no time to write, I was reluctant that so intimate an acquaintance
of yours should come to you without a note from me. But, considering
the pace of philosophers, I imagine the present letter will reach you
first. If, however, you have got that earlier letter now, you will know
that I arrived at Athens on Oct. 14; that on disembarking at the port
I received your letter from our friend Acastus; that, perturbed though
I was at your arrival in Rome with a fever, nevertheless I began to
take heart at Acastus' welcome announcement of your convalescence; but
shivered myself at your news of Caesar's legions, and pleaded with you
to beware lest friend Philotimus' time-serving injure us.[2] As for
the point I touched on long ago (misrepresented to you by Turranius at
Brundisium, as I gathered from a letter received from that good fellow
Xeno), I set forth briefly the reason why I had not put my brother
in charge of the province. Those practically were the topics of that
letter. Now hear what remains.

In heaven's name, I want all the affection which you have lavished on
me, and all your worldly

in omni genere iudico singularem, confer ad eam curam, ut de omni statu
meo cogites. Videre enim mihi videor tantam dimicationem, nisi idem
deus, qui nos melius, quam optare auderemus, Parthico bello liberavit,
respexerit rem publicam,--sed tantam, quanta numquam fuit. Age, hoc
malum mihi commune est cum omnibus. Nihil tibi mando ut de eo cogites,
illud meum proprium πρόβλεμα, quaeso, suscipe. Videsne, ut te auctore
sim utrumque complexus? Ac vellem a principio te audisse amicissime
monentem.

             Ἀλλ' ἐμὸν οὔποτε θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἔπειθες.

Sed aliquando tamen persuasisti, ut alterum complecterer, quia de me
erat optume meritus, alterum, quia tantum valebat. Feci igitur itaque
effeci omni obsequio, ut neutri illorum quisquam esset me carior.
Haec enim cogitabamus, nec mihi coniuncto cum Pompeio fore necesse
peccare in re publica aliquando nec cum Caesare sentienti pugnandum
esse cum Pompeio. Tanta erat illorum coniunctio. Nunc impendet, ut et
tu ostendis, et ego video, summa inter eos contentio. Me autem uterque
numerat suum, nisi forte simulat alter. Nam Pompeius non dubitat; vere
enim iudicat ea, quae de re publica nunc sentiat, mihi valde probari.
Utriusque autem accepi eius modi litteras eodem tempore quo tuas, ut
neuter quemquam omnium pluris facere quam me videretur. Verum quid
agam? Non quaero illa ultima (si enim

wisdom, which I swear to my mind is unrivalled in every subject, to
be devoted to a careful estimate of my whole position. For myself, I
seem to foresee a terrific struggle, unless indeed the same god, who
wrought above my boldest hopes in freeing us from a Parthian war, take
pity on the state--anyhow, such a terrific struggle as there never has
been before. True, the calamity would fall not only on me, but on every
one. I don't ask you to consider the wider problem: solve my own little
case, I entreat. Don't you see that it is you who are responsible
for my friendship with both Pompey and Caesar? Ah, would that I had
listened to your friendly admonitions from the outset.

[Sidenote: Odyssey ix, 33]

"Thou couldst not sway the spirit in my breast."

But at last, however, you persuaded me to be friendly with the one,
because he had done so much for me; with the other, because he was
so powerful. Well, I did so, and I have studiously contrived to be
particularly dear to both of them. For my idea was this. Allied with
Pompey, I should never have to be guilty of political impropriety; and,
siding with Caesar, I should not have to fight with Pompey. So close
was the alliance of those two. But now, on your showing and in my view,
there threatens a dire struggle between them. Each of them counts me
his friend--unless, perhaps, Caesar is dissembling; for Pompey has
no doubt, rightly supposing that his present political views have my
strongest approval. But both have sent me letters (which came with
yours) in terms that would appear to make more of me than of anyone at
all. But what am I to do? I don't mean in the long run. If the matter
is to be fought in the

castris res geretur, video cum altero vinci satius esse quam cum
altero vincere), sed illa, quae tum agentur, cum venero, ne ratio
absentis habeatur, ut exercitum dimittat. "DIC, M. TVLLI." Quid
dicam? "Exspecta, amabo te, dum Atticum conveniam"? Non est locus ad
tergiversandum. Contra Caesarem? "Ubi illae sunt densae dexterae?" Nam,
ut illi hoc liceret, adiuvi rogatus ab ipso Ravennae de Caelio tribuno

Quis? Tu ipse scilicet, laudator et factorum et scriptorum meorum. Hanc
ergo plagam effugi per duos superiores Marcellorum consulatus, cum est
actum de provincia Caesaris, nunc incido in discrimen ipsum? Itaque ut
stultus[3] primus suam sententiam dicat, mihi valde placet de triumpho
nos moliri aliquid, extra urbem esse cum iustissuma causa. Tamen
dabunt operam, ut eliciant sententiam meam. Ridebis hoc loco fortasse.
Quam vellem etiam nunc in provincia morari! Plane opus fuit, si hoc
impendebat. Etsi nil miserius. Nam, ὁδῦυ πάρεργον, volo te hoc scire.

_have been suggested in place of_ stultus.

field, I see it would be better to be beaten with Pompey than
to win with Caesar. But what about the points in debate on my
arrival--refusing the claims of a candidate who is away from Rome and
ordering the disbanding of his army. "Your opinion, Marcus Tullius,"
will be the question. What am I to say? "Please wait till I meet
Atticus?" There is no chance of evasion. I speak against Caesar? "Where
then the pledge of plighted hands?"[4] For I assisted in getting Caesar
privilege on these two points, when I was asked by him personally at
Ravenna to approach Caelius the tribune to propose a bill. Asked by him
personally, do I say? Yes, and by our friend Pompey in that immortal
third consulship.

[4] Probably a quotation from some early poet.

Shall I choose the other course? "I fear" not only Pompey, but "the
men and long-robed dames of Troy": "Polydamas will be the first to
rail."[5] Who's he? Why, you, who praise my work and writings. Have I
then avoided this trap during the last two consulships of the Marcelli,
when the matter of Caesar's province was under debate, only to fall
now into the thick of the trouble? That some fool may have the first
vote on the motion, I feel strongly inclined to devote my energies to
my triumph, a most reasonable excuse for staying outside the city.
Nevertheless they will try to extract my opinion. Perhaps this will
excite your mirth: I wish to goodness I were still staying in my
province. I certainly ought to have stayed, if this was coming: though
it would have been most wretched. For by the way

Omnia illa prima, quae etiam tu tuis litteris in caelum ferebas,
ἐπίτηκτα fuerunt. Quam non est facilis virtus! Quam vero difficilis
eius diuturna simulatio! Cum enim hoc rectum et gloriosum putarem,
ex annuo sumptu, qui mihi decretus esset, me C. Caelio quaestori
relinquere annuum, referre in aerarium ad HS CIↃ, ingemuit nostra
cohors omne illud putans distribui sibi oportere, ut ego amicior
invenirer Phrygum et Cilicum aerariis quam nostro. Sed me non moverunt;
nam et mea laus apud me plurimum valuit, nec tamen quicquam honorifice
in quemquam fieri potuit, quod praetermiserim. Sed haec fuerit, ut ait
Thucydides, ἐκβολὴ λόγου non inutilis.

Tu autem de nostro statu cogitabis, primum quo artificio tueamur
benevolentiam Caesaris, deinde de ipso triumpho; quem video, nisi
rei publicae tempora impedient, εὐπόριστον. Iudico autem cum ex
litteris amicorum tum ex supplicatione. Quam qui non decrevit, plus
decrevit, quam si omnes decresset triumphos. Ei porro adsensus est
unus familiaris meus, Favonius, alter iratus, Hirrus. Cato autem et
scribendo adfuit et ad me de sententia sua iucundissimas litteras
misit. Sed tamen gratulans mihi Caesar de supplicatione triumphat
de sententia Catonis nec scribit, quid ille sententiae dixerit, sed
tantum, supplicationem eum mihi non decrevisse.

there is one thing I want to tell you. All that show of virtue at
first, which even you praised sky high in your letters, was only
superficial. Truly righteousness is hard: hard even to pretend to it
for long. For, when I thought it a fine show of rectitude to leave my
quaestor C. Caelius a year's cash out of what was decreed me for my
budget and to pay back into the treasury £8,800,[6] my staff, thinking
all the money should have been distributed among them, lamented that
I should turn out to be more friendly to the treasuries of Phrygia
and Cilicia than to our own. I was unmoved: for I set my good name
before everything. Yet there is no possible honour that I have omitted
to bestow on any of these knaves. This, in Thucydides' phrase, is a
digression--but not pointless.

[6] 1,000,000 sesterces.

[Sidenote: Thuc. i, 97]

But as to my position. You will consider first by what trick I can
retain Caesar's good will: and then the matter of my triumph, which,
barring political obstacles, seems to me easy to get: I infer as
much from letters from friends and from that business of the public
thanksgiving in my honour. For the man who voted against it,[7] voted
for more than if he had voted for all the triumphs in the world;
moreover his adherents were one a friend of mine, Favonius, and another
an enemy, Hirrus. Cato both took part in drafting the decree, and sent
me a most agreeable letter about his vote. But Caesar, in writing to
congratulate me over the thanksgiving, exults over Cato's vote, says
nothing about the latter's speech on the occasion, and merely remarks
that he opposed the proclamation of a thanksgiving.

ipsum, me, quicquid possem nummorum, ad apparatum sperati triumphi ad
te redacturum. Ita puto ἄμεμπτα fore; verum ut lubebit. Hanc quoque
suscipe curam, quem ad modum experiamur. Id tu et ostendisti quibusdam
litteris ex Epiro an Athenis datis, et in eo ego te adiuvabo.

I come back to Hirrus. You have begun to reconcile him to me;
accomplish it. Scrofa and Silius are on your side. I have already
written to them and to Hirrus himself. For Hirrus had told them in a
friendly way that he could easily have prevented the decree, but was
reluctant; that, however, he had sided with Cato, my very good friend,
when the latter recorded a vote complimenting me in the highest terms.
Hirrus added that I had omitted to write to him, though I had sent
letters to every one else. He was right. It was only to him and to
Crassipes that I did not write. So much for public life. Let us come
home.

I wish to dissociate myself from that fellow Philotimus. He is a
veritable muddler, a regular Lartidius[8].

[8] Taken by the older commentators to be a Latin form of Λαερτιάδης
(i.e. Ulysses); but the sense does not seem to warrant the comparison,
which could only mean "as wily as Ulysses."

"A truce to what is past for all our pain."[9]

[9] _Iliad_ xviii, 112; xix, 65, "Let bygones be bygones."

Let us settle what remains; and first this point, which adds anxiety
to my sorrow. This sum, I mean, whatever it is, which comes from
Precius, I do not want mixed up with the accounts of mine of which that
fellow has the handling. I have written to Terentia and to Philotimus
himself that I shall deposit with you any moneys I may collect, for
the equipment of the triumph I anticipate. So I fancy there will be no
_amour propre_ wounded: but as they like. Here is another matter for
your consideration--the steps I am to take to arrange this business.
You outlined them in a letter dated from Epirus or Athens, and I will
support your plan.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Brundisium, Nov. 26_, B.C. _50_]

I arrived at Brundisium on the 24th of November after enjoying your
proverbial luck at sea: so fair for me "blew from Epirus the softest
of breezes, Onchesmites." There, that verse with its spondaic ending
you can pass off for your own on any of our new school of poets[10] you
like. Your health causes me great anxiety; for I see from your letter
that you really suffer. But, knowing your spirit, I strongly suspect
there is something serious which compels you to give in and nearly
causes a breakdown, although your Pamphilus tells me that one fit of
quartan has passed, and that a second and lighter attack is coming
on. But Terentia (who reached Brundisium's gates as I reached the
harbour, and met me in the forum) told me that L. Pontius had informed
her at Trebula that the second attack also had abated. If that is so,
my utmost hopes are realized, and I expect that consummation has been
attained by your caution and moderate habits.

I come to your letters, which have reached me in shoals, each more
delightful than the last--I mean those in your own handwriting. I like
Alexis' hand; it so closely resembles your own script; but there is one
thing I do not like about it--it shows that you are ill. Talking of
Alexis, I left Tiro sick at Patrae; he is, as you know, a young man,
and you may add, if you like, an honest fellow. Nothing

probum. Nihil vidi melius. Itaque careo aegre et, quamquam videbatur
se non graviter habere, tamen sum sollicitus, maximamque spem habeo in
M'. Curi diligentia, de qua ad me scripsit Tiro et multi nuntiarunt.
Curius autem ipse sensit, quam tu velles se a me diligi, et eo sum
admodum delectatus. Et mehercule est, quam facile diligas, ἀυτόχθων
in homine urbanitas. Eius testamentum deporto trium[11] Ciceronum
signis obsignatum cohortisque praetoriae. Fecit palam te ex libella,
me ex terruncio. In Actio Corcyrae Alexio me opipare muneratus est. Q.
Ciceroni obsisti non potuit, quo minus Thyamim videret. Filiola tua
te delectari laetor et probari tibi φυσικὴι esse τὴν πρὸς τὰ τέκνα.
Etenim, si haec non est, nulla potest homini esse ad hominem naturae
adiunctio; qua sublata vitae societas tollitur, "Bene eveniat!" inquit
Carneades spurce, sed tamen prudentius quam Lucius noster et Patron,
qui, cum omnia ad se referant, numquam quicquam alterius causa fieri
putent et, cum ea re bonum virum oportere esse dicant, ne malum habeat,
non quo id natura rectum sit, non intellegant se de callido homine
loqui, non de bono viro. Sed haec, opinor, sunt in iis libris, quos tu
laudando animos mihi addidisti.

could be better than Tiro. So I miss him terribly, and, though he did
not seem very bad, still I am anxious, and build great hopes on the
care of M'. Curius, about which Tiro has written and many people have
told me. Curius himself was aware of your desire that he should win my
esteem: and I am greatly charmed with him. Indeed he is one of nature's
gentlemen, whom it is easy to like. I carry home his will sealed with
the seals of three of my family and of the praetor's staff. In the
presence of witnesses he made you heir to a tenth of his estate and
me to a fortieth.[12] At Actium in Corcyra Alexio made me a splendid
present. Q. Cicero could not be stopped from seeing the river Thyamis.
I am glad you take delight in your baby daughter, and have satisfied
yourself that a desire for children is natural.[13] For, if it is not,
there can be no natural tie between man and man; remove that tie,
and social life is destroyed. "Heaven bless the consequence," says
Carneades naughtily, but with more wisdom than our philosophers Lucius
and Patron, who in sticking to selfish hedonism and denying altruism,
and saying that man must be virtuous for fear of the consequences of
vice and not because virtue is an end in itself, fail to see that they
are describing a type not of goodness but of craftiness. But these
points, I think, are handled in the volumes[14] you have encouraged me
by praising.

but here the _denarius_ is used as the standard. The _libella_ was
one-tenth and the _teruncius_ one-fortieth of a _denarius_.

quam Philoxeno dedisses! Scripseras enim in ea esse de sermone Pompei
Neapolitano. Eam mihi Patron Brundisi reddidit. Corcyrae, ut opinor,
acceperat. Nihil potuit esse iucundius. Erat enim de re publica, de
opinione, quam is vir haberet integritatis meae, de benevolentia,
quam ostendit eo sermone, quem habuit de triumpho. Sed tamen hoc
iucundissimum, quod intellexi te ad eum venisse, ut eius animum erga me
perspiceres. Hoc mihi, inquam, accidit iucundissimum. De triumpho autem
nulla me cupiditas umquam tenuit ante Bibuli impudentissimas litteras,
quas amplissume supplicatio consecuta est. A quo si ea gesta essent,
quae scripsit, gauderem et honori faverem; nunc illum, qui pedem porta,
quoad hostis cis Euphratem fuit, non extulerit, honore augeri, me, in
cuius exercitu spem illius exercitus habuit, idem non adsequi, dedecus
est nostrum, nostrum inquam te coniungens. Itaque omnia experiar, et ut
spero, adsequar. Quodsi tu valeres, iam mihi quaedam explorata essent.
Sed, ut spero, valebis.

De raudusculo Numeriano multum te amo. Hortensius quid egerit, aveo
scire, Cato quid agat; qui quidem in me turpiter fuit malevolus. Dedit
integritatis, iustitiae, clementiae, fidei mihi testimonium, quod non
quaerebam; quod postulabam, negavit id. Itaque Caesar eis litteris,
quibus mihi gratulatur et omnia pollicetur, quo modo exsultat Catonis
in me ingratissmi iniuria! At hic idem Bibulo dierum XX.

you said was entrusted to Philoxenus! For it was to contain news of
Pompey's talk at Naples. Patron handed it to me at Brundisium. It was
at Corcyra, I fancy, he had taken charge of it. Nothing could be more
delightful. It touched on politics, the great man's opinion of my
honour, the kindliness he displayed in his remarks about my triumph.
But the most delightful item of all was the intelligence that you had
called on him to find out his feeling towards me. This, I repeat, was
what I found most delightful. As for a triumph, I had no desire for
one up to the time Bibulus sent his shameless despatches and got a
thanksgiving voted in the most complimentary way. Now, if he had done
what he professed to have done, I should have been glad and supported
the honour; but, as it is, it is a disgrace to us--to both of us: for
I include you in the business--that I, on whose army his army relied,
should not get the same rewards as a man who never set foot outside
the city gates so long as there was an enemy this side of Euphrates.
Therefore I shall make every effort, and, as I hope, shall succeed. If
you were well, some points would have been settled already; but I hope
you will soon be well.

For that twopenny debt to Numerius I am much bounden to you. I long to
know what Hortensius has done about my triumph and what Cato is doing.
Cato's behaviour to me was shamefully spiteful. He gave me a character
for rectitude, equity, clemency, and good faith, for which I did not
ask; what I did want, that he denied me. Accordingly in his letter of
congratulation and lavish assurances, how Caesar exults over the wrong
Cato did me by his deep ingratitude! Yet Cato voted Bibulus a twenty
days'

Ignosce mihi; non possum haec ferre nec feram.

Cupio ad omnes tuas epistulas, sed nihil necesse est; iam enim te
videbo. Illud tamen de Chrysippo--nam de altero illo minus sum
admiratus, operario homine; sed tamen ne illo quidem quicquam
improbius. Chrysippum vero, quem ego propter litterularum nescio quid
libenter vidi, in honore habui, discedere a puero insciente me! Mitto
alia, quae audio multa, mitto furta; fugam non fero, qua mihi nihil
visum est sceleratius. Itaque usurpavi vetus illud Drusi, ut ferunt,
praetoris, in eo, qui eadem liber non iuraret, me istos liberos non
addixisse, praesertim cum adesset nemo, a quo recte vindicarentur. Id
tu, ut videbitur, ita accipies; ego tibi adsentiar.

Uni tuae disertissimae epistulae non rescripsi, in qua est de periculis
rei publicae. Quid rescriberem? valde eram perturbatus. Sed ut nihil
magno opere metuam, Parthi faciunt, qui repente Bibulum semivivum
reliquerunt.

CICERO ATTICO SAL.


[Sidenote: _Scr. in Trebulano V Id. Dec. a. 704_]

A. d. VIII Idus Decembr. Aeculanum veni et ibi tuas litteras legi, quas
Philotimus mihi reddidit. E quibus hanc primo aspectu voluptatem cepi,

festival. Forgive me, I cannot and I will not bear it.

I long to answer all your letters; but there is no need, for soon I
shall see you. Still I must tell you about Chrysippus--the conduct of
that other fellow, a mere mechanic, excites my surprise less, though
it could not have been more scandalous. But Chrysippus, whom I was
always glad to see and held in honour, because he had a smattering of
culture, fancy him deserting my son without my knowledge! I can put
up with other things, though I hear of plenty, I can even put up with
embezzlement; but I cannot put up with his flight. It is the most
scandalous thing I ever heard of. So I have taken a leaf from Drusus'
book, when, in his praetorship, as the story goes, a man, who had been
manumitted, refused to take the oaths he had promised: and I have
denied that those fellows ever were freed by me, especially as there
were no legal witnesses to the transaction. Take it any way you will: I
will abide by your decision.

The only one of your letters, which I have not answered, is the most
eloquent of them all, dealing with the country's peril. I have no
answer to make: I am very much upset. But the Parthians, whose sudden
retreat left Bibulus half dead with fright, have taught me not to be
much alarmed at anything.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Trebula, Dec. 9_, B.C. _50_]

On the 6th of December I came to Aeculanum, and there I read your
letter, which Philotimus handed to me. I was pleased at the first
glance to see it was

       *       *       *       *       *

                                Page 20

erant a te ipso scriptae, deinde earum accuratissuma diligentia sum
mirum in modum delectatus. Ac primum illud, in quo te Dicaearcho
adsentiri negas, etsi cupidissume expetitum a me est et te approbante,
ne diutius anno in provincia essem, tamen non est nostra contentione
perfectum. Sic enim scito, verbum in senatu factum esse numquam de ullo
nostrum, qui provincias obtinuimus, quo in iis diutius quam ex senatus
consulto maneremus, ut iam ne istius quidem rei culpam sustineam, quod
minus diu fuerim in provincia, quam fortasse fuerit utile. Sed "quid
si hoc melius?" opportune dici videtur ut in hoc ipso. Sive enim ad
concordiam res adduci potest sive ad bonorum victoriam, utriusvis rei
me aut adiutorem velim esse aut certe non expertem; sin vincuntur
boni, ubicumque essem, una cum iis victus essem. Quare celeritas
nostri reditus ἀμεταμέλητος debet esse. Quodsi ista nobis cogitatio de
triumpho iniecta non esset, quam tu quoque adprobas, ne tu haud multum
requireres illum virum, qui in sexto libro informatus est. Quid enim
tibi faciam, qui illos libros devorasti? Quin nunc ipsum non dubitabo
rem tantam abicere, si id erit rectius. Utrumque vero simul agi non
potest, et de triumpho ambitiose et de re publica libere. Sed ne
dubitaris, quin, quod honestius, id mihi futurum sit antiquius. Nam,
quod putas utilius esse, vel mihi quod tutius sit, vel etiam ut rei
publicae prodesse possim, me esse cum imperio, id coram considerabimus
quale sit. Habet enim res deliberationem; etsi ex parte magna

in your handwriting; and I was highly delighted at the care
and attention it showed. First you say that you disagree with
Dicaearchus.[15] Now, though I was exceedingly anxious, and that with
your approval, not to stay in my province more than a year, it was
not my own efforts that gained the point. For you should know that no
word was ever said in the House about any of us provincial governors
outstaying the term of our appointment; so that now I am not to be
blamed even for making a shorter stay in my province than was perhaps
to my advantage. But "all for the best" is an apt saying, as it is in
this case. For, if peace can be patched up, or the loyalists can be
made to win the victory, I should be sorry not to assist or at any
rate have a hand in the matter. But, if the loyalists are conquered, I
should share their defeat wherever I were. So my speedy return ought
not to cost me any regret. If this idea of a triumph that you approve
had not come into my head, you would find me not far short of the ideal
statesman I sketched in the sixth volume.[16] What would you have me
do, you devourer of those books of mine? Even now I will not hesitate
to throw away my great ambition, if that course is better. One cannot
of course play both parts at once, the selfish candidate for triumph
and the independent politician. But doubt not that I shall take honesty
to be my best policy. As for your point that it were better for me,
whether for my private safety, or for the public welfare, that I should
retain my command, we will talk it over together. It is a matter for
deliberation,

active life. He was a pupil of Aristotle, and wrote philosophical and
geographical works.

tibi adsentior. De animo autem meo erga rem publicam bene facis quod
non dubitas, et illud probe indicas, nequaquam satis pro meis officiis,
pro ipsius in alios effusione illum in me liberalem fuisse, eiusque
rei causam vere explicas, et eis, quae de Fabio Caninioque acta
scribis, valde consentiunt. Quae si secus essent, totumque se ille in
me profudisset, tamen illa, quam scribis, custos urbis me praeclarae
inscriptionis memorem esse cogeret, nec mihi concederet, ut imitarer
Volcacium aut Servium, quibus tu es contentus, sed aliquid nos vellet
nobis dignum et sentire et defendere. Quod quidem agerem, si liceret,
alio modo, ac nunc agendum est.

De sua potentia dimicant homines hoc tempore periculo civitatis. Nam,
si res publica defenditur, cur ea consule isto ipso defensa non est?
cur ego, in cuius causa rei publicae salus consistebat, defensus
postero anno non sum? cur imperium illi aut cur illo modo prorogatum
est? cur tanto opere pugnatum est, ut de eius absentis ratione habenda
decem tribuni pl. ferrent? His ille rebus ita convaluit, ut nunc in uno
civi spes ad resistendum sit; qui mallem tantas ei vires non dedisset
quam nunc tam valenti resisteret,

                                Page 23

though I agree with you in the main. You do well not to doubt my
attitude towards politics: and you judge rightly that Caesar has
not been liberal to me considering my services, and considering his
lavishness towards others. You explain his reasons rightly: I am in the
same boat with Fabius and Caninius,[17] as your letter shows. But if
things were otherwise and he had been profuse in his generosity towards
me, nevertheless the goddess you mention, the guardian of the city,
would have compelled me to remember her fine inscription, and would
not allow me to imitate Volcacius or Servius,[18] with whom you are
content, but would wish me to express and maintain a policy worthy of
my name. And I should have done it, if I could, in a different way from
the way I must adopt now.

[17] _Legati_ of Caesar: but nothing is known of any slight on them.

[18] Before his exile Cicero dedicated a statue of Minerva in the
Capitol with the inscription _Custos Urbis_. Possibly, however, there
was a longer inscription. Volcacius and Servius maintained neutrality
in the civil war.

It is for their own power men are fighting now to the danger of the
country. For if the constitution is being defended, why was it not
defended when Caesar himself was consul? Why was I, on whose case the
safety of the constitution depended, not defended in the following
year? Why was Caesar's command prolonged, or why was it prolonged in
such a fashion? Why was there such a struggle to get the ten tribunes
to bring in a bill allowing him to stand in his absence? All this has
made him so strong that now hope of resistance depends on one citizen.
I wish that citizen had not given him so much power rather than that he
now resisted him in the hour of

Sed, quoniam res eo deducta est, non quaeram, ut scribis:

                      Ποῦ σκάφος τὸ τῶν Ἀτρειδῶν;

mihi σκάφος unum erit, quod a Pompeio gubernabitur. Illud ipsum quod
ais: "Quid fiet, cum erit dictum: DIC, M. TVLLI?"--σύντομα: "CN. POMPEIO
ADSENTIOR." Ipsum tamen Pompeium separatim ad concordiam hortabor.
Sic enim sentio, maxumo in periculo rem esse. Vos scilicet plura,
qui in urbe estis. Verum tamen haec video, cum homine audacissimo
paratissimoque negotium esse, omnes damnatos omnes ignominia adfectos,
omnes damnatione ignominiaque dignos illac facere, omnem fere
iuventutem omnem illam urbanam ac perditam plebem, tribunos valentes

intellego, quam putaram (causam solum ilia causa non habet, ceteris
rebus abundat), hic omnia facere omnes, ne armis decernatur; quorum
exitus semper incerti, nunc vero etiam in alteram partem magis timendi.

Bibulus de provincia decessit, Veientonem praefecit; in decedendo erit,
ut audio, tardior. Quem cum ornavit Cato, declaravit iis se solis non
invidere, quibus nihil aut non multum ad dignitatem posset accedere.

Nunc venio ad privata; fere enim respondi tuis litteris de re publica,

his strength. But since things have come to such a pass, I shall not
ask, to borrow your quotation,

"Where is the bark of Atreus' sons?"[19]

[19] Euripides _Troades_ 455 ποῦ σκάφος τὸ τοῦ στρατηγοῦ

My only bark will be that which has Pompey for a pilot. For your
query "What will happen when the question is put 'Your vote, Marcus
Tullius'"--briefly "I vote with Pompey." Still I shall exhort Pompey
privately to pacific measures. I feel that there is the greatest
danger. You, who are in town, will know more. Yet I see that we have
to do with a man of the greatest daring and readiness, who has on his
side all the criminal and social outcasts, and all who deserve to be
counted criminals and outcasts; nearly all the younger generation; all
the lowest city rabble; the powerful tribunes including C. Cassius; all
the insolvent, who are more in number than I imagined. All his cause
wants is a good cause: it has everything else in plenty. On our side we

ego mihi ab illo non rationes exspectabam, quas tibi edidit, verum

view, that I think he must be sorry he changed his own. But what is
this story of Lucceius' property being knocked down to him? I wonder
you passed that over. As for Philotimus I shall take your advice. But
I was not expecting from him the accounts, which he gave you: I was
expecting the balance, which he wished me to enter in my note-book with
my own hand at Tusculum, and for which he gave me in Asia a certificate
in his own hand. If he should pay up all the money he told you was
owing to me, he would still owe me as much again and even more. But,
if only politics will allow, I shall not incur blame hereafter in
matters of this kind. Indeed I have not been careless hitherto; but my
time has been taken up by a crowd of friends. I shall therefore have
your industry and advice, as you promise, and I hope I shall not be
troublesome in the matter. You have no reason to lament the treatment
that I meted to my crooked staff.[20] They pulled themselves together
in amaze at my honesty. But nobody surprised me more than the man whom
you think a nobody. From first to last he was and is splendid. But just
at my departure he showed me that he had hoped for some reward; and
yet he did not long cling to the idea which had entered his mind, but
quickly came to himself again, and overwhelmed by the honours I had
done him, regarded them as of more worth than any money.

"Piraeea" scripserim, non "Piraeum" (sic enim omnes nostri locuti

ut loco. Et tamen Dionysius noster et, qui est nobiscum, Nicias Cous
non rebatur oppidum esse Piraeea. Sed de re ego[21] videro. Nostrum
quidem si est peccatum, in eo est, quod non ut de oppido locutus sum,
sed ut de loco, secutusque sum non dico Caecilium:

"Máne ut ex portu ín Piraeum"

(malus enim auctor Latinitatis est), sed Terentium, cuius fabellae

Caelius has taken the Porta Flumentana,[22] I don't see why I should
not make Puteoli mine.

[22] Caelius had bought Lucceius' property near the Porta Flumentana at
the entrance of the Campus Martius.

Coming to the form _Piraeea_, I am more to be blamed for writing it
thus and not _Piraeum_ in Latin, as all our people do, than I am
for adding the preposition "_in_." I used "_in_" as before a word
signifying a place and not a town. After all Dionysius and Nicias of
Cos, who is with me, do not consider that the Piraeus is a town. I will
look into the question. If I have made a mistake, it is in speaking of
it not as a town but as a place, and I have authority. I do not depend
on a quotation from Caecilius: "_Máne ut ex portu in Piraeum_,"[23] as
he is a poor authority in Latinity; but I will quote Terence, whose
fine style caused his plays to be ascribed to C. Laelius "_Heri áliquot
adulescéntuli coíimus in Piraeum_," and again: "_Mercátor hoc addébat,
captam e Súnio_."[24] If we want to call parishes towns, Sunium is as
much a town as the Piraeus. But, since you are a purist, you will save
me a lot of trouble, if you can solve the problem for me.

[24] Terence, _Eun._ 539 (yesterday while some of us youths met in the
Piraeus), and 115 (The merchant added one thing more, a female slave
from Sunium). In the first the MSS. of Terence read _Piraeo_.

Caesar sends me a friendly letter. Balbus does the same on his account.
Certainly I shall not swerve a finger's breadth from the strictest
honour; but you know how much I still owe him. Don't you think there is
fear that this may be cast in my teeth, if I am slack; and repayment
demanded from me, if I am energetic? What solution is there?

him very obliging, careful of my good name, an honest fellow, and, not
to give him a mere freedman's character, evidently a man of honour.

my arrival, encouraged me about my triumph, promised to do his part,
warned me not to enter the House till my business was finished,
for fear I should make an enemy of some tribune by the opinions I
expressed. In short, promises could go no further. As to the political
situation, he hinted certain war, without hope of agreement. It
appeared that, though he had long understood there was a split between
himself and Caesar, he had had very recent proof of it. Hirtius, a
very intimate friend of Caesar's, had come and had not called on
Pompey. Besides Hirtius had arrived on the evening of the 6th of
December and Balbus had arranged a meeting with Pompey's father-in-law
before daybreak on the 7th to discuss affairs, when, lo, late on the
night before, Hirtius set out to go to Caesar. This seemed to Pompey
proof positive of a split. In a word I have no consolation except the
thought, that, when even his enemies have renewed his term of office
and fortune has bestowed on him supreme power, Caesar will not be so
mad as to jeopardize these advantages. If he begins to run amuck, my
fears are more than I can commit to paper. As things are, I meditate a
visit to town on the 3rd of January.

your trouble. Both of you do your best to get well. As for Tiro I see
you are attending to him. Though when in health, he is marvellously
useful to me in every department of business and literature, it is not
a selfish motive, but his own charming character and modest bearing
that prompts my hope for his recovery. Philogenes has never said
anything to me about Luscenius. As for other matters Dionysius is with
you. I am astonished your sister has not come to Arcanum. I am glad you
approve my plan about Chrysippus. I shall not go to Tusculum at such a
time as this, not I. It is out of the way for chance _rencontres_ and
has other drawbacks. But from Formiae I go to Tarracina on the last
of December. Thence to the upper end of the Pomptine marsh: thence to
Pompey's Alban villa: and so to Rome on the 3rd, my birthday.

The political crisis is causing me greater fear every day. The
loyalists are not, as is imagined, in agreement. I have met numbers
of Roman knights, and numbers of Members, ready to inveigh bitterly
against everything and especially this journey of Pompey's. Peace is
our want. Victory will bring many evils, and without doubt a tyrant.
But this we shall soon discuss together. I have no news at all now:
each of us knows as much as the other about political affairs, and
domestic details are for us common knowledge.

All one can do is to jest--if _he_ will allow it. For I am one who
thinks it better to agree to his demands than to enter upon war. It is
late to resist him, when for ten years we have nurtured this viper in
our bosom. Then you ask my view. It is the same as yours; and I shall
express none till my own affairs

"Dionysius, an excellent fellow--as I too have found him--a good
scholar and your very stanch friend, arrived in Rome on the 16th of
December, and gave me a letter from you." That's all you say about
Dionysius in your letter. You do not add "and he expressed his
gratitude to you." Yet certainly he ought to have done so, and, if he
had, you would have added it with your usual good nature. I cannot make
a _volte face_ about him, owing to the character I gave him in the
former letter. Let us call him then an honest fellow. He has done me
one kindness at any rate in giving me this further chance to know him
thoroughly. Philogenes is correct in what he wrote: he duly settled
his debt. I wanted him to use the money as long as he could; so he has
used it for 14 months. I hope Pomptinus is getting well. You mention
his entrance into town. I am somewhat anxious as to what it means: he
would not have entered the city except for some good reason. As the 2nd
of January is a holiday, I don't wish to reach Pompey's Alban villa on
that date for fear I should be a nuisance to his household. I shall go
there on the 3rd, and then visit the city on the 4th. I forget on what
day the fever will attack you again; but I would not have you stir to
the damage of your health.

As for my triumph, unless Caesar has been secretly intriguing through
his tribune partisans, all else seems smooth and easy. My mind is
absolutely at ease, and I regard the whole business with indifference,
especially as many people tell me that Pompey and his advisers

an faeneratores an agricolas, quibus optatissimum est otium? nisi

have determined to send me to Sicily, because I still have military
powers. That is a muddle-headed plan.[30] For neither has the House
decreed, nor the people authorized me to have military power in Sicily.
If the state delegates the appointment to Pompey, why should he send
me rather than any unofficial person? So, if this military power is
going to be a nuisance, I shall get rid of it by entering the first
city gate I see. As for your news that there is a wonderful interest
in my arrival and that none of the "right or right enough party"
doubt as to my future action, I don't understand your phrase "the
right party." I don't know of such a party, that is if we look for a
class; of course there are individuals. But in political splits it is
classes and parties we want. Do you think the Senate is "right," when
it has left our provinces without military rule? For Curio could never
have held out, if there had been negotiations with him--a proposal
rejected by the House, which left Caesar without a successor. Is
it the tax-collectors, who have never been loyal and are now very
friendly with Caesar? Or is it the financiers or the farmers, whose
chief desire is peace? Do you suppose they will fear a king, when they
never declined one so long as they were left in peace? Well then, do
I approve of the candidature of a man who keeps his army beyond the
legal term? No, not even of his candidature in absence. But when the
one privilege was granted, the other went with it. Do I then approve of
the extension of his military power for ten years, and that carried as
it was carried? Then I should have to approve of my own banishment, the
throwing away of the Campanian land on the people, the adoption

of a patrician by a plebeian, of that gentleman of Gades by the man of
Mytilene.[31] And I should have to approve of the wealth of Labienus
and Mamurra and the gardens and Tusculan estate of Balbus. But the
source of all these evils is one. We ought to have resisted him when
he was weak: that would have been easy. Now there are eleven legions,
cavalry as much as he wants, the northern tribes across the Po, the
city riff-raff, all the tribunes of the people, the young profligates,
a leader of such influence and daring. We must either fight him or
allow his candidature according to the law. "Fight," say you, "rather
than be slaves." The result will be proscription if beaten and slavery
even if one wins. "What shall I do then?" What the cattle do, who when
scattered follow flocks of their own kind. As an ox follows the herd,
so shall I follow the "right party," or whoever are said to be the
"right party," even if they rush to destruction. The best course in our
straits is clear to me. No one can tell the issue of war: but every one
can tell that, if the right party are beaten, Caesar will not be more
merciful than Cinna in slaying the nobility, nor more moderate than
Sulla in robbing the rich. I have discussed _la haute politique_ long
enough, and I would do so longer, had not my lamp gone out. The end is
"Your vote, Marcus Tullius." I vote with Pompey, that is with Titus
Pomponius.

himself received the citizenship from Pompey.

Please remember me to Alexis, a very clever boy, unless perhaps in my

There was no need for you to give such strong assurances about
Dionysius. A hint from you would have satisfied me. But your silence
gave me all the more reason for suspicion, because you are used to
cement friendships with good-natured assurances, and because I heard
that he used different language about us to others. However, your
letter convinces me. So I behave to him exactly as you wish.

Your bad day too I had noted from a letter you wrote at the beginning
of your feverishness, and I had calculated that under the circumstances
you could conveniently meet me at the Alban villa on the 3rd of
January. But please do nothing to affect your health. A day or two will
make no difference.

Dolabella, I see, by Livia's will shares a third of her estate with two
others, but is asked to change his name. It is a social problem whether
it is proper for a young noble to change his name under a lady's will.
But we can determine that on more scientific grounds, when we know to
how much a third of a third amounts.

Your guess that I should meet Pompey before coming to Rome has come
true. On the 25th he overtook me near the Lavernium. We reached Formiae
together, and were closeted together from two o'clock till evening. For
your query as to the chance of a peaceful settlement, so far as I could
tell from Pompey's full and detailed discourse, he does not even want
peace. Pompey thinks that the constitution will be subverted even if
Caesar is elected consul without

an army; and he fancies that when Caesar hears of the energetic
preparations against him, he will give up the idea of the consulship
this year, and prefer to keep his army and his province. Still, if
Caesar should play the fool, Pompey has an utter contempt for him, and
firm confidence in his own and the state's resources. Well, although
the "uncertainty of war" came constantly into my mind, I was relieved
of anxiety as I listened to a soldier, a strategist, and a man of the
greatest influence discoursing in a statesmanlike way on the risks of
a hollow peace. We had before us a speech of Antony made on the 21st
of December, which attacked Pompey from boyhood, complained about the
condemnation of certain people and threatened war. Pompey's comment
was "What do you suppose Caesar will do, if he becomes master of the
state, when a wretched, insignificant subordinate dares to talk in
this strain?" In a word, he appeared not only not to seek peace, but
even to fear it. But I fancy the idea of leaving the city shakes his
resolution. What annoys me most is that I have to pay up to Caesar, and
devote to the purpose what I should have used for my triumph. It is
bad form to owe money to a political opponent. But this and many other
topics can wait till we meet.

when I arrive. I see I have missed one of your letters: my friend L.
Quinctius was wounded and robbed near the tomb of Basilus, while he
was bringing it. So you must see if there was any news in it I ought
to have, and you shall solve me this inevitable problem of politics to
boot. It may be necessary for us to admit Caesar as a candidate while
he keeps his army, be it by the favour of the House or the tribunes. Or
we may have to persuade him to take office on condition of giving up
his province and his troops. Or, if he will not yield to persuasion on
that point, we may refuse to admit him as a candidate at the election,
and he may endure the treatment and keep his province. Or, if he
employs the tribunes to interfere, yet keeps the peace, a political
deadlock may be brought about. Or, if he uses force, because we reject
him as a candidate, we may have to fight and he may begin at once
before we are ready, or when his friends fail to get his candidature
allowed at the elections in accordance with his legal privilege. He may
resort to arms solely on account of his rejection as a candidate, or
for a further reason, if a tribune through using obstructionist tactics
or an appeal to popular feeling incur a censure or a limitation of
power or suspension or expulsion from office, or if some tribune fly to
him with a tale of expulsion. War begun, we must either hold the city
or abandon it and cut him off from food and supplies. Of these evils
some one must be borne: consider which in your opinion is the lightest.
Of course you will say, "Induce him to give up his army and so take
the consulship." True there can be no objection to that, if he will
condescend, and I wonder he does not, if he cannot get his candidature
supported

facere miror. Nobis autem, ut quidam putant, nihil est timendum magis
quam ille consul. "At sic malo," inquies, "quam cum exercitu." Certe;
sed istud ipsum "sic" magnum malum putat aliquis, neque ei remedium est
ullum. "Cedendum est, si id volet." Vide consulem illum iterum, quem
vidisti consulatu priore. "At tum imbecillus plus," inquis, "valuit

est esse in Hispania. O rem miseram! si quidem id ipsum deterrimum
est, quod recusari non potest, et quod ille si faciat, iam iam a bonis
omnibus summam ineat gratiam. Tollamus igitur hoc, quo illum posse
adduci negant; de reliquis quid est deterrimum? Concedere illi, quod,
ut idem dicit, impudentissime postulat. Nam quid impudentius? Tenuisti
provinciam per annos decem, non tibi a senatu, sed a te ipso per vim et
per factionem datos; praeteriit tempus non legis, sed libidinis tuae,
fac tamen legis; ut succedatur, decernitur; impedis et ais: "Habe meam
rationem." Habe tu nostram. Exercitum tu habeas diutius, quam populus
iussit, invito senatu? "Depugnes oportet, nisi concedis." Cum bona
quidem spe, ut ait idem, vel vincendi vel in libertate moriendi. Iam,
si pugnandum est, quo tempore, in casu, quo consilio, in temporibus
situm est. Itaque te in ea quaestione non exerceo; ad ea, quae dixi,
adfer, si quid habes. Equidem dies noctesque torqueor.

while he keeps his army. But for us some think that nothing could be
worse than Caesar in office. You may say, "Better so, than with an
army." Certainly: but Pompey thinks that very "so" fatal, and there is
no remedy for it. "We must submit to Caesar's will." But imagine him
in office again after your experience of his former tenure. You will
reflect that, weak as he was, he was too strong for the constitution.
What about him now? And now, if Caesar is consul, Pompey will remain in
Spain. What a plight! since the worst of all is the very alternative
which we cannot refuse him, and the one which, if he takes it, will of
itself win him the favour of the right party. This course it is said
he will not accept; let us put it out of court. Which is the worst
of the remaining alternatives? To concede his impertinent demand, as
Pompey terms it? Impertinent it is indeed. You have had a province for
ten years, not allotted by the Senate, but by yourself through force
and insubordination. This term, not a legal term, but a term of your
own will and pleasure--or say, this legal term--comes to an end. The
House passes a decree for the appointment of a successor. You object
and cry, "Consider my candidature." Consider our case. Are you to dare
the House and keep your army longer than the nation sanctions? "You
must fight or yield." Then as Pompey says, let us hope for victory,
or death with freedom. If we must fight, the time depends on chance,
the plan of campaign on circumstances. So I do not trouble you on that
point. But make any suggestion you can on my remarks. Day and night I
am tormented.

Well, let him keep his fortune. For my part, let me bask one hour in
your clime's free gift of[35] sunlight, rather than win any kingdom
of that sort. Better a thousand times to die than once to meditate
such villainy. "Suppose you conceive a desire for it," you say. Desire
is free to anyone; but I would rather be crucified than have such a
desire. There is only one worse fate, to obtain your desire. But enough
of this. It eases me to philosophize a trifle in our present straits.

[35] Or "precious." The meaning is very doubtful.

To come back to Pompey. What, in heaven's name, do you think of his
plan? I mean his desertion of Rome. I don't know what to make of it.
Besides nothing could be more ridiculous. Leave the city? Would you
then have done the same if the Gauls were coming? He may object that
the state does not consist of lath and plaster. But it does consist of
hearths and altars. "Themistocles abandoned Athens." Yes, because one
city could not stand the flood of all the barbarians of the East. But
Pericles did not desert her about fifty years later, though he held
nothing but the walls. Once too our ancestors lost the rest of Rome,
but they kept the citadel.

    The heroes of an elder day."

On the other hand to judge from the indignation in the towns and the
talk of my acquaintances, it looks to me as if Pompey's flight would be
a success. Here there is an extraordinary outcry (whether in

object to any concession to Caesar. Explain to me what it all means.

My task is peaceful. Pompey wishes me to act as surveyor over the whole

business. So I expect to be a wanderer. I imagine you realize Caesar's

your opinion as to what I ought or ought not to do. As to your request
for information on Pompey's policy, I don't think he knows himself;
certainly none of us know. I saw Lentulus the consul at Formiae on the
21st. I saw Libo. Everywhere there is panic and confusion. Pompey is on
the road to Larinum; for there are cohorts there and also at Luceria
and Teanum and in the rest of Apulia. No one knows whether he

will make a stand anywhere or cross the sea. If he remains in Italy,
I fear it is impossible for him to have a reliable army. If he leaves
Italy, where he will go or stay, and what we are to do I don't know.
For I imagine that Caesar, whom you fear may be a Phalaris, will stick
at no abominations. He will not be deterred by adjournment of public
business, the departure of members and magistrates and the closure of
the treasury. But, as you say, we shall know soon.

Meanwhile forgive me for writing so much and so often; it soothes
me, and I wish to extract letters from you, and especially advice as
to where to go and what to do. Shall I give myself up heart and soul
to the good cause? I am not terrified by the danger, but tortured
by the anguish. To think that everything has been done with such a
lack of plan, or so contrary to my plan! Or shall I hesitate and play
the turncoat, and join the party that holds the field? "I fear the
Trojans," and I am held back not only by my duty as a citizen, but by
my duty as a friend; though I am often shaken by pity for the boys. So
write a line to me in my distress, although you have the same worries;
and especially as to what you think I should do, if Pompey leaves
Italy. I have met M'. Lepidus and he draws the line there; so does L.
Torquatus. There are many obstacles before me, including my lictors.
I have never seen such an intricate tangle. So I do not look to you
for positive advice: but only for your opinion. In fact I want to know
how the dilemma presents itself to you. It is practically certain that
Labienus has left Caesar. If it could have been arranged that he could
meet magistrates and Senate on his arrival at

De Vennonianis rebus tibi assentior. Labienum ἥρωα iudico. Facinus iam

Rome, he would have been of great service to our cause. Loyalty it
would have appeared had made him regard his friend a traitor: it
appears so as it is, but it is of less use. For there is no cause to
serve, and I imagine that he is sorry at leaving Caesar, unless perhaps
the report is false. Myself I think it true.

And please give me a sketch of city affairs, though according to your
account you keep to your house. Is Pompey missed? Does Caesar seem
disliked? What do you think about Terentia and Tullia? Should they
remain in Rome, or join me, or seek some refuge? On these and any other
topics pray write to me, I mean write often.

In the matter of Vennonius I agree with you. Labienus I consider a
hero. There has been no public action of such distinction for a long
time. If he has done nothing else, he has at least hurt Caesar's
feelings. But I think he has served our main interests as well. I am
delighted too with Piso. His judgement on his son-in-law[36] should
carry weight. However, you see the nature of our struggle. It is civil
war, though it has not sprung from division among our citizens, but
from daring of one abandoned citizen. He is strong in military forces,
he attracts adherents by hopes and promises, he covets the whole
universe. Rome is delivered to him stripped of defenders, stocked with
supplies: one may

quod ab eo non metuas, qui illa templa et tecta non patriam, sed
praedam putet? Quid autem sit acturus aut quo modo, nescio, sine
senatu, sine magistratibus. Ne simulare quidem poterit quicquam
πολιτικῶς. Nos autem ubi exsurgere poterimus aut quando? Quorum dux
quam ἀστρατήγητος, tu quoque animadvertis, cui ne Picena quidem nota
fuerint; quam autem sine consilio, res testis. Ut enim alia omittam
decem annorum peccata, quae condicio non huic fugae praestitit? Nec
vero, nunc quid cogitet, scio ac non desino per litteras sciscitari.
Nihil esse timidius constat, nihil perturbatius. Itaque nec praesidium,
cuius parandi causa ad urbem retentus est, nec locum ac sedem praesidii
ullam video. Spes omnis in duabus insidiose retentis paene alienis
legionibus. Nam dilectus adhuc quidem invitorum est et a pugnando
abhorrentium. Condicionum autem amissum tempus est. Quid futurum sit,
non video; commissum quidem a nobis certe est sive a nostro duce, ut e
portu sine gubernaculis egressi tempestati nos traderemus.

Itaque de Ciceronibus nostris dubito quid agam; nam mihi interdum
amandandi videntur in Graeciam; de Tullia autem et Terentia, cum
mihi barbarorum adventus ad urbem proponitur, omnia timeo; cum autem
Dolabellae venit in mentem, paulum respiro. Sed velim consideres, quid
faciendum putes primum πρὸς τὸ ἀσφαλές (aliter enim mihi de illis ac

fear anything from a man who regards her temples and her homes not as
his native land, but as his loot. What he will do, and how he will do
it, in the absence of House and magistrates, I do not know. He will be
unable even to pretend constitutional methods. But where can our party
raise its head or when? You, too, remark how poor a soldier our leader
is; why, he did not even know how things were in Picenum; and the
crisis shows his lack of policy. Pass over other faults of the last ten
years. What compromise were not better than this flight? I do not know
what he is thinking of doing now, though I inquire by constant letters.
It is agreed that his alarm and confusion has reached the limit. He
was kept in Italy to garrison Rome, but no garrison or place to post a
garrison can I see. We depend entirely on two legions that were kept
here by a trick, and are practically disloyal. For so far the levy has
found unwilling recruits, afraid of war. But the time of compromise is
passed. The future is obscure. We, or our leader, have brought things
to such a pass, that having put to sea without a rudder, we must trust
to the mercy of the storm.

So I hesitate what to do with the boys. Sometimes I think of sending
them to Greece. As for Tullia and Terentia, when I picture the approach
of the barbarians on Rome, I am terrified. But the thought of Dolabella
is some small relief to my mind. Please consider my best course, in
the first place with an eye to safety, for their safety stands on a
different footing to mine, and then with regard to possible criticism,
if I leave them in Rome, when the loyal are all in flight. Even you and
Peducaeus must be careful what you do, as he writes to me. For your

reservation that he should withdraw his garrison from the towns he
has occupied outside his own province. That done, they said, we would
return to Rome and settle business in the House. I hope for the present

The settlers in Campania are hanging back. As for Caesar's professional
fighting men at Capua, about whom I misinformed you on the authority
of A. Torquatus, Pompey has very cleverly distributed them two a-piece
to heads of families. There were 5,000 heavy armed gladiators in the

provision for the safety of the state.

As for my women-folk, among whom is your sister, I entreat you to

those estates on the sea-coast, which is under my care, so that they
can live there without much inconvenience, considering the state of
affairs. For, if I give offence by the conduct of my son-in-law (though
I am not his keeper), the fact that my women-folk stay in Rome after
others have left makes matters worse. I should like to know what you

Capuam cum venissem a. d. VI Kal. pridie, quam has litteras dedi,
consules conveni multosque nostri ordinis. Omnes cupiebant Caesarem
abductis praesidiis stare condicionibus iis, quas tulisset; uni Favonio
leges ab illo nobis imponi non placebat. Sed is haud auditus[41]
in consilio. Cato enim ipse iam servire quam pugnare mavult; sed
tamen ait in senatu se adesse velle, cum de condicionibus agatur,
si Caesar adductus sit, ut praesidia deducat. Ita, quod maxime opus
est, in Siciliam ire non curat; quod metuo ne obsit, in senatu esse
vult. Postumius autem, de quo nominatim senatus decrevit, ut statim
in Siciliam iret Furfanioque succederet, negat se sine Catone iturum
et suam in senatu operam auctoritatemque quam magni aestimat. Ita
res ad Fannium pervenit. Is cum imperio in Siciliam praemittitur. In
disputationibus nostris summa varietas est. Plerique negant Caesarem
in condicione mansurum postulataque haec ab eo interposita esse, quo
minus, quod opus esset ad bellum, a nobis pararetur. Ego autem eum puto
facturum, ut praesidia deducat. Vicerit enim, si consul factus erit, et
minore scelere vicerit, quam quo ingressus est. Sed accipienda plaga
est. Sumus enim flagitiose imparati cum a militibus tum a pecunia; quam
quidem omnem non modo privatam, quae in urbe est, sed etiam publicam,
quae in aerario est, illi reliquimus. Pompeius ad legiones Appianas[42]
est profectus; Labienum secum habet. Ego tuas opiniones de his rebus
exspecto. Formias me continuo recipere cogitabam.

particular news, but I wanted to talk with you in my absence. When we
cannot talk face to face, there is nothing I like better.

I reached Capua yesterday, the 25th, where I met the consuls and many
fellow-members. All hope that Caesar will abide by his conditions,
accepting the withdrawal of his garrisons: only Favonius objects to
his dictating to us. But no one listened to him. For even Cato now
prefers slavery to war: but he wants to be in the House when the terms
are debated, if Caesar can be induced to withdraw his garrisons. So he
does not care to do what would be most useful, and go to Sicily: and
he wants to be in the House, where I fear he will cause trouble. The
Senate definitely decreed that Postumius should set out for Sicily at
once and succeed Furfanius. Postumius replied he would not go without
Cato; he has a great idea of his own value and influence in the House.
So choice fell on Fannius; he is dispatched to Sicily with military
power. In our debates there is great difference of opinion. Most
declare that Caesar will not stick to his compact, and that his demands
were only introduced to hinder our preparations for war. I fancy,
however, that he will withdraw his garrisons. For he will win his
point, if he is elected consul, and win it with less scandal than by
his first course. But the blow must be borne. We are sinfully unready
in men and money: for we have left him not only our private purses
in the city, but the state funds in the treasury. Pompey along with
Labienus has set out for Appius' legions. I want your views on this. I
think of returning to Formiae at once.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Cales, Jan. 28_, B.C. _49_]

I think all your letters reached me, but the first out of proper
order, the others as they were dispatched by Terentia. About Caesar's
ultimatum, the arrival of Labienus, and the reply of Pompey and the
consuls, I informed you in my letter of the 26th of January from Capua,
and I threw in a deal of other information besides. Now we have two
things to wait for, first what Caesar will do on receipt of the terms
given to L. Caesar to convey to him, and secondly what Pompey is doing
now. Pompey indeed writes to me that in a few days he will have a
strong force, and he encourages me to hope, that, if he enters Picenum,
we shall return to Rome. Labienus accompanies him, confident in the
weakness of Caesar's forces. His arrival has much encouraged Pompey.
The consuls have ordered me to go to Capua by the 5th of February.

I set out from Capua for Formiae on the 28th of January. On receipt of
your letter at Cales on that day about three o'clock I write this by
return. As for Terentia and Tullia I agree with you, and I have written
to them to consult you. If they have not yet started, there is no
reason for them to bestir themselves, till we see how things are.

cum fuga ex Italia quaeri videbatur. Nos enim Hispaniam peteremus;
illis hoc aeque commodum non erat. Tu ipse cum Sexto etiam nunc mihi
videris Romae recte esse posse; etenim minime amici Pompeio nostro esse
debetis. Nemo enim umquam tantum de urbanis praediis detraxit. Videsne
me etiam iocari?

Scire iam te oportet, L. Caesar quae response referat a Pompeio, quas
ab eodem ad Caesarem ferat litteras. Scriptae enim et datae ita sunt,
ut proponerentur in publico. In quo accusavi mecum ipse Pompeium, qui,
cum scriptor luculentus esset, tantas res atque eas, quae in omnium
manus venturae essent, Sestio nostro scribendas dederit. Itaque nihil
umquam legi scriptum σηστιωδέστερον. Perspici tamen ex litteris Pompei
potest nihil Caesari negari omniaque ei cumulate, quae postulet,
dari. Quae ille amentissimus fuerit nisi acceperit, praesertim cum
impudentissime postulaverit. Quis enim tu es, qui dicas: "Si in
Hispaniam profectus erit, si praesidia dimiserit"? Tamen conceditur
minus honeste nunc quidem violata iam ab illo re publica illatoque
bello, quam si olim de ratione habenda impetrasset. Et tamen vereor,
ut his ipsis contentus sit. Nam, cum ista mandata dedisset L. Caesari,
debuit esse paulo quietior, dum responsa referrentur; dicitur autem
nunc esse acerrimus.

flight from Italy seemed likely. For I myself should have gone to
Spain, but it would not have been so suitable for them. I fancy you and
Sextus may well stay in Rome even now; for you are not in the least
bound to be Pompey's friends: no one has ever depreciated city property
so much as Pompey. I must have my joke still, you see.

You should know already the reply that Pompey is sending by Lucius
Caesar, and the nature of his letter to Caesar; for it was written and
sent on purpose to be published. Mentally I blamed Pompey who, though a
clear writer himself, gave Sestius the task of drawing up documents of
such importance, which were to come into every one's hands. Accordingly
I have never seen anything more Sestian in its style.[43] Still it is
plain from the letter that nothing can be denied to Caesar, and that
the whole bulk of his demands are to be granted. He will be utterly mad
to reject the terms, particularly when his demands are most impudent.
Pray, who are you, Caesar, to insist "Provided Pompey go to Spain,
provided he dismiss his garrisons"? Still the demand is being granted,
but it has cost us more loss of dignity now that he has outraged the
sanctity of the state and waged war against it, than if he had obtained
his previous request to be admitted a candidate. And yet I fear he may
want more. For when he entrusted his ultimatum to L. Caesar, he should
have kept a little quiet until he received a reply. But he is said now
to be more energetic than ever.

[43] Cf. Catullus xliv for comments on Sestius' style. Sestius was
defended by Cicero in 56 B.C. with a speech which is extant.

Trebatius indeed writes to me that Caesar requested

coepisse, ne omnes abessemus. Itaque non dubito, quin ad Pisonem, quin
ad Servium scripserit; illud admiror, non ipsum ad me scripsisse, non
per Dolabellam, non per Caelium egisse. Quamquam non aspernor Trebati

him on the 22nd of January to write and beg me to remain near the
city; that would win me his best thanks. All this at great length. I
calculated from the date, that as soon as he heard of my departure
Caesar began to be concerned lest we should all go from town. So I have
no doubt he wrote to Piso and to Servius. One thing surprises me that
he did not write to me himself, or approach me through Dolabella or
Caelius. However, I am not offended at a letter from Trebatius, who is
my particular wellwisher. I would not reply to Caesar himself, as he
had not written to me; but I wrote to Trebatius how difficult such a
course would be at this juncture, but that I was staying on my country
estates, and had not undertaken any part in the levy or any business.
To this I will stand so long as there is any prospect of peace; but, if
it comes to war, I shall act as becomes my duty and rank, after stowing
away my boys to Greece. For all Italy, I gather, will blaze with war.
Such a catastrophe is caused partly by disloyalty, partly by jealousy
amongst her citizens. The outcome will be known in a few days from
Caesar's answer to our letter. Then, if it be war, I will write again:
if it be peace or a respite, I shall hope to see you.

On the 2nd of February, the date of this letter, I await my women-folk
in my place at Formiae, whence I have returned from Capua. I wrote to
them on your advice to stay in Rome. But I hear that panic has rather
increased there. I want to be at Capua on the 5th of February, as the
consuls have ordered. Any news we get here from Pompey I will let you
know at once, and I shall look to letters from you for news from the
city.

On the 2nd of February my women-folk came to Formiae and brought me an
account of your very kind and zealous attentions. I wished them to stay
in my villa here along with the boys, till we know whether we are to
have peace with dishonour, or war with its horrors. I and my brother
start for Capua on the 3rd of February, the date of this letter, to
meet the consuls on the 5th according to their instructions.

Pompey's reply to Caesar is said to please the people, and to have won
the approval of a public meeting. I expected it. If Caesar rejects
this condition, he will fall in esteem: if he accept----. You will
ask my choice in the matter. I would answer, if I knew our state of
preparation. It is reported here that Cassius has been driven from
Ancona, and that our party hold the town. That will be a useful thing
in the event of war. As for Caesar, though he has sent L. Caesar
with negotiations for peace, nevertheless reports declare that he is
collecting levies with the greatest energy, seizing posts, and securing
the country with garrisons. What a villain robber! What a disgrace to
the country, too dear a price to pay for any peace! But let us restrain
our anger, yield to circumstance and accompany Pompey to Spain. That
is my choice in our straits, since we did not take the chance when we
had it of keeping him from his second consulship.[46] But enough of
politics.

[46] Or "since we refused him his second consulship, when we had no
choice in the matter."

De Dionysio fugit me ad te antea scribere; sed ita constitui,
exspectare responsa Caesaris, ut, si ad urbem rediremus, ibi nos
exspectaret, sin tardius id fieret, tum eum arcesseremus. Omnino, quid
ille facere debuerit in nostra illa fuga, quid docto homine et amico
dignum fuerit, cum praesertim rogatus esset, scio, sed haec non nimis
exquiro a Graecis. Tu tamen videbis, si erit, quod nolim, arcessendus,
ne molesti simus invito.

Quintus frater laborat, ut tibi, quod debet, ab Egnatio solvat; nec
Egnatio voluntas deest, nec parum locuples est, sed, cum tale tempus
sit, ut Q. Titinius (multum enim est nobiscum) viaticum se neget habere
idemque debitoribus suis denuntiarit, ut eodem faenore uterentur, atque
hoc idem etiam L. Ligus fecisse dicatur, nec hoc tempore aut domi
nummos Quintus habeat aut exigere ab Egnatio aut versuram usquam facere
possit, miratur te non habuisse rationem huius publicae difficultatis.
Ego autem, etsi illud ψευδησιόδειον (ita enim putatur) observo μηδὲ
δίκην, praesertim in te, a quo nihil umquam vidi temere fieri, tamen

It escaped my memory to write to you about Dionysius before: but my
determination is this, to await Caesar's answer, so that, if I return
to Rome, Dionysius may await me there; but, if there is delay, then I
would summon him. I am quite aware of what he ought to have done when I
took to flight, what was proper for a scholar and a friend, especially
when he had been asked to do it: but I do not expect much from a Greek.
But please see, if I have to summon him, which I hope I shall not, that
I may not be troubling a reluctant man.

My brother Quintus is anxious to give you a draft on Egnatius for the
money he owes, and Egnatius is willing and has plenty of cash; but when
the times are such that Q. Titinius,[47] whom I see often, declares he
has no money to get along with, and yet has told his debtors that they
may let their debts stand over at the same rate of interest as before,
and when L. Ligus too is said to have taken the same steps, and Quintus
at the present time has no money in hand, and is unable to borrow from
Egnatius or to raise a new loan anywhere, he is surprised that you
have not taken into account our national straits. Though I observe the
saying wrongly ascribed to Hesiod "Hear both sides,"[48] particularly
in the case of yourself, whom I have always found considerate, still I
was affected by his grievance. You ought to know his grievance, such as
it is.

[Sidenote: _Formiae, Feb. 3_, B.C. _49_]

I have no news for you, and have not even sent you my lucubration of
last night: for that was a letter full of good cheer, because I had
heard of the temper shown at the public meeting, and thought that
Caesar would abide by terms which were in fact his own. But now on
this, the morning of the 3rd of February, I have got a letter from you,
one from Philotimus, one from Furnius, and one from Curio to Furnius
ridiculing the mission of L. Caesar. We appear to be crushed utterly,
nor do I know what plan to take. I am not indeed in trouble about
myself, it is the boys that put me in a dilemma. Still I am setting out
for Capua, as I write this, that I may more easily get to know Pompey's
affairs.

The occasion makes me brief. I have abandoned hope of peace: but our
party takes no steps for war. Pray don't suppose that there is anything
of less concern to our present consuls than the war. I came to Capua
on the 4th according to instructions, in heavy rain, with the hope of
hearing something from them and getting to know of our equipment. They
had not yet arrived, but were expected, emptyhanded, unprepared. Pompey
was reported to be at Luceria and close to some cohorts[50] of the shaky

[50] Or "and some cohorts are approaching."

Appian troops. Caesar is said to be tearing along, and is nearly on
us, not to join battle--there is no one to join it with--but to cut
us off from flight. Now, if it is to be in Italy, I am ready to die
with her--and on that I need not ask your advice: but if the struggle
is beyond her borders, what am I to do? The winter, my lictors,
the improvidence and neglect of the leaders prompt me to stay: my
friendship with Pompey, the cause of the loyalists, the disgrace of
association with a tyrant, prompt me to flee. One cannot say whether
that tyrant will choose Phalaris or Pisistratus as his model. Please
unravel this and assist me with your advice. Though I suppose you are
in a warm corner in Rome, still help me to the best of your ability. I
will advise you if anything new crops up here to-day. The consuls will
arrive on the 5th as arranged. I shall look for a letter every day: but
answer this one as soon as you can. I have left the ladies and the boys

Of our troubles you hear sooner than I. It is from your quarter they
come. No good news can be expected from here. I reached Capua on the
5th of February, as the consuls bade. Lentulus arrived late in the day.
The other consul had not arrived at all on the 7th: for on that day I
left Capua and stayed at Cales. On the 8th before daybreak I dispatch
you this letter from there. The discovery I made at Capua was that no
reliance is to be placed on the consuls, and that no levy is being made
anywhere. For recruiting officers do not dare to show their faces

Idus Febr. Capuam C. Cassius tribunus pl. venit, attulit mandata ad
consules, ut Romam venirent, pecuniam de sanctiore aerario auferrent,
statim exirent. Urbe relicta redeant; quo praesidio? deinde exeant;
quis sinat? Consul ei rescripsit, ut prius ipse in Picenum. At illud
totum erat amissum; sciebat nemo praeter me ex litteris Dolabellae.
Mihi dubium non erat, quin ille iam iamque foret in Apulia, Gnaeus
noster in navi.

Ego quid agam σκέμμα magnum--neque mehercule mihi quidem ullum, nisi
omnia essent acta turpissime, neque ego ullius consilii particeps--sed
tamen quod me deceat. Ipse me Caesar ad pacem hortatur; sed antiquiores

when Caesar is at hand, and our leader is nowhere to be found and
takes no action. No one enlists. It is not good will that is lacking,
but hope. What an inconceivable plight is Pompey's, and how utterly
he has broken down! He has neither spirit nor plan, nor forces, nor
energy. I say nothing of his most disgraceful flight from the city,
his timorous speeches in the towns, his ignorance not only of the
strength of his opponent but of his own forces: but what of this? On
the 7th of February C. Cassius the tribune came to Capua, and brought
an order to the consuls to come to Rome, carry off the money from the
reserve treasury[51] and leave at once. On quitting the city they are
to return--but they have no escort: then there is the getting out
of the city--who is going to give them leave? Lentulus replied that
Pompey must first come to Picenum. No one except myself knows it; but
Dolabella has written to me that that district is totally lost. I have
no doubt but that Caesar is on the point of entering Apulia and that
Pompey is on board ship.

[51] This reserve fund was said to have been founded originally to meet
a possible invasion of the Gauls. It was made up from spoils in war
and from the 5 per cent tax on manumitted slaves. It was drawn upon in
the second Punic War (cf. Livy XXVII, 11). Caesar (_Bellum Civ._ 14)
says the consuls intended to open it before they left Rome; but fled in
haste at a report of his approach.

What I am to do is a big problem. It would be no problem for me at
all, if everything had not been disgracefully managed; and I had no
part in the plan: still my proper course is a problem. Caesar himself
invites to peace: but the letter is dated before he began to run amuck.
Dolabella and Caelius declare that he is well satisfied with me. I am
at my wits'

I see there is not a foot of ground in Italy which is not in Caesar's
power. I have no news of Pompey, and I imagine he will be captured
unless he has taken to the sea. What marvellous dispatch! While our
leader--: but it grieves me to blame him, as I am in an agony of
suspense on his account. There is reason for you to fear butchery, not
that anything could be less advantageous to secure Caesar a lasting
victory and power; but I see on whose advice he will act. I hope it
will be all right; and I think we shall have to yield. As regards the
Oppii I have no suggestion to make. Do what you think best. You should
speak with Philotimus, and besides you will have Terentia on the 13th.
What can I do? In what land or on what sea can I follow a man, when I
don't know where he is? After all how can I follow on land, and by sea
whither? Shall I then surrender to Caesar? Suppose I could surrender
with safety, as many advise, could I surrender with honour? By no
means. I will ask your advice as usual. The problem is insoluble.
Still, if anything comes into your head, please write; and let me know
what you will do yourself.

[Sidenote: _Formiae, the evening of Feb. 9 or the morning of Feb. 10_,
B.C. _49_]

On the evening of the 9th of February, I got a letter from Philotimus,
declaring that Domitius has a reliable force, the cohorts from Picenum
under the command of Lentulus and Thermus have joined his army, Caesar
can be cut off and fears the contingency, and the hopes of loyalists
at Rome have been restored, and those of the other party dashed. I am
afraid this may be a dream; but still the news revived M'. Lepidus, L.
Torquatus and C. Cassius the tribune of the plebs--for they are with
me, that is at Formiae. I fear the truer version may be that we are now
all practically prisoners, that Pompey is leaving Italy, pursued it is
said by Caesar. What a bitter thought! Caesar pursue Pompey! What, to
slay him? Woe is me! And we do not all throw our bodies in the way! You
too are sorry about it. But what can we do? We are beaten, ruined and
utterly captive.

Still the perusal of Philotimus' letter has caused me to change my plan
about the women-folk. I wrote you I was sending them back to Rome: but
it has come into my mind that there would be a deal of talk, that I had
now come to a decision on the political situation; and that in despair
of success the return of the ladies of my house was as it were one step
towards my own return. As for myself, I agree with you that I should
not commit myself to the danger and uncertainty of flight, seeing that
it would avail nothing to State or Pompey, for whom I would dutifully
and gladly die. So I shall stay, though life--.

For your query as to the state of affairs in this quarter, Capua
and the levy are in stagnation: our cause is despaired of: every
one is in flight, unless some god help Pompey to join that army of
Domitius with his own. It would seem that we shall know all in a day
or so. As requested I send you a copy of Caesar's letter. Many of my
correspondents say that he is quite satisfied with me. I can allow
that, provided I continue to do nothing to stain my honour.

Philotimus' letter delighted me little, but those who are here
considerably. Well, on the very next day a letter of Cassius from his
friend Lucretius at Capua announced that Nigidius, an emissary of
Domitius, had reached Capua, bringing news that Vibullius with a few
soldiers was hurrying in from Picenum to Pompey's camp, that Caesar
was pursuing rapidly and that Domitius had less than 3000 men. The
letter stated that the consuls had left Capua. I am sure Pompey must be
fleeing: I only hope he may escape. I accept your advice and have no
intention of flight myself.

After I had sent you a despondent and, I fear, true report about the
letter Lucretius dispatched to Cassius from Capua, Cephalio came to me
from you with a letter more cheerful, but not as decided as usual. Any
news is more credible than your news of Pompey having an army. No one

Non venit idem usu mihi, quod tu tibi scribis, "quotiens exorior."

interdicta:

that Pompey has always won in a bad cause, but fails in the best of
causes. The only solution is that he knew the ropes in the former

It is a difficult art to rule a republic in the right way. At any

I have not had what you say is your experience:--"as often as my hopes
revive." Only now are mine reviving a little, and especially over
letters from Rome about Domitius and the squadrons of Picenum. Things
have become more cheerful in the last two days. I have given up my
preparation for flight. I spurn Caesar's threat: "If I shall meet thee
here to-morrow morn."[55] The news about Domitius is good, that about
Afranius is splendid.

[55] From a Latin translation of Euripides, _Medea_, 352.

Thanks for your very friendly advice, not to commit myself more than I
can help. You add a caution against showing a leaning towards the wrong
party: well, I confess I may seem to. I refused to take a leading part
in civil war, so long as there were negotiations for peace, not because
the war was unjust, but because former action of mine in a still juster
cause did me harm. I had no desire at all to excite the enmity of a man
to whom our leader offered a second consulship, and a triumph too with
the fulsome flattery "on account of your brilliant achievements." I
know whom I have to fear and why.

answer to your repeated letters about the man's duty, because daily I

my boys will certainly winter at Formiae. And I? I don't know. For, if

After I sent you my letter, I got one from Pompey. The rest of it was
about what has happened in Picenum, as reported to him by Vibullius in
a note, and about Domitius' levy. That you know already: but in this
letter things were not so grand as in Philotimus' letter. I would have
sent you Pompey's note itself, but my brother's man set out in a hurry,
so I will send it to-morrow. Pompey added a P.S. in his own hand, "I
think you should come to Luceria. You won't be safer anywhere else."
I understood him to mean that he counts as lost the towns here and
the coast. I don't wonder that a man who has given up the head should
throw away the limbs. I sent a reply by return, by the hands of a sure
messenger, that I was not concerned about where I should be safest,
and that I would come to Luceria immediately, if his or the public
interest demanded it. I entreated him to hold the coast, if he wanted
supplies of corn from the provinces. I saw I was writing in vain: but I
wanted to put on record now my opinion about not abandoning Italy, as
I had done before about holding Rome. Evidently all forces are to be
collected at Luceria, and not even there as a permanent base, but as a
starting point for flight, if hard pressed.

Unus Pompeius me movet beneficio, non auctoritate. Quam enim ille
habeat auctoritatem in hac causa? qui, cum omnes Caesarem metuebamus,
ipse eum diligebat, postquam ipse metuere coepit, putat omnes hostes
illi oportere esse. Ibimus tamen Luceriam. Nec eum fortasse delectabit

Mihi vero omnia grata, et quod scripsisti ad me, quae audieras, et quod
non credidisti, quae digna diligentia mea non erant, et quod monuisti,
quod sentiebas. Ego ad Caesarem unas Capua litteras dedi, quibus ad ea
rescripsi, quae mecum ille de gladiatoribus suis egerat, breves, sed
benevolentiam significantes, non modo sine contumelia, sed etiam cum
maxima

So you need not wonder, if I am reluctant to embark on a cause, which
has no policy for peace or victory, but always a policy of disastrous
and disgraceful flight. I must go to face whatever fortune bring, with
so-called loyalists rather than seem to disagree with real loyalists.
Yet I see Rome will soon be crammed with loyalists, I mean with men of
wealth and fortune, crammed full, when the towns have been abandoned. I
would be among them, were it not for these tiresome lictors. I should
not be ashamed of the company of M'. Lepidus, L. Volcacius, Ser.
Sulpicius, not one of whom is a bigger fool than L. Domitius, nor a
bigger trimmer than Ap. Claudius. Only Pompey weighs with me, for his
past kindnesses, not for his public influence. For what influence has
he in this case? When we were all afraid of Caesar, he cherished him.
After he has begun to fear Caesar, he thinks all should be Caesar's
enemies. Still I shall go to Luceria. Perhaps he will not be pleased to
meet me, for I shall not be able to disguise my disgust at what he has
done so far. If I could sleep, I would not bother you with such long
letters. If you suffer from the same complaint, I shall be glad if you
will pay me back in the same coin.

Many thanks for everything: for writing me your news, for not believing
a report, which reflected on my energy, and for the expression of your
opinion. I sent Caesar one letter from Capua in answer to his inquiries
about his gladiators.[58] It was short but friendly, and, so far from
abusing Pompey,

laude Pompei. Id enim illa sententia postulabat, qua illum ad
concordiam hortabar. Eas si quo ille misit, in publico proponat velim.
Alteras eodem die dedi quo has ad te. Non potui non dare, cum et
ipse ad me scripsisset et Balbus. Earum exemplum ad te misi. Nihil
arbitror fore, quod reprehendas. Si qua erunt, doce me, quo modo
μέμψιν effugere possim. "Nihil," inquies, "onmino scripseris." Qui
magis effugias eos, qui volent fingere? Verum tamen ita faciam, quoad
fieri poterit. Nam, quod me hortaris ad memoriam factorum, dictorum,
scriptorum etiam meorum, facis amice tu quidem mihique gratissimum,
sed mihi videris aliud tu honestum meque dignum in hac causa iudicare,
atque ego existimem. Mihi enim nihil ulla in gente umquam ab ullo
auctore rei publicae ac duce turpius factum esse videtur, quam a nostro
amico factum est. Cuius ego vicem doleo; qui urbem reliquit, id est
patriam, pro qua et in qua mori praeclarum fuit. Ignorare mihi videris,
haec quanta sit clades. Es enim etiam nunc domi tuae, sed invitis
perditissimis hominibus esse diutius non potes. Hoc miserius, hoc
turpius quicquam? Vagamur egentes cum coniugibus et liberis; in unius
hominis quotannis periculose aegrotantis anima positas omnes nostras
spes habemus non expulsi, sed evocati ex patria; quam non servandam ad
reditum nostrum, sed diripiendam et inflammandam reliquimus. Ita multi
nobiscum sunt, non in suburbanis, non in hortis, non in ipsa urbe, et,
si nunc sunt, non erunt. Nos interea ne Capuae quidem, sed Luceriae,
et oram quidem maritimam iam relinquemus, Afranium exspectabimus et
Petreium. Nam in Labieno parum est dignitatis.

praised him highly. I had to do that, as I was an advocate of peace
between them. If Caesar has passed on my letter, good: I should like
him to placard it in public. I have sent him another letter on the
date on which I dispatch this to you. I could not help doing so when
he and Balbus wrote to me. I send you a copy of the letter. I don't
think you can find any fault. If you can find any, tell me how I can
escape criticism. You will say I should have sent no letter at all.
What better plan to escape malicious tongues? However I will do so as
long as I can. Your exhortations to remember my deeds and words and
even writings are friendly and very pleasant; but you seem to have a
different idea to mine as to honour and propriety in this business. To
my mind, no statesman or general has ever been guilty of conduct so
disgraceful as Pompey's. I am sorry for him. He left Rome, his country,
for which and in which it were glorious to die. You don't seem to me
to realize what a disaster that is. You yourself are still in your own
house; but you cannot stay there any longer without the consent of
villains and traitors. It is the depth of misery and shame. We wander
in want with wives and children. Our sole hope lies in the life of
one man, who falls dangerously sick every year. We are not driven,
but summoned to leave our country. And our country which we have left
will not be kept in safety against our return, but abandoned to fire
and plunder. So many Pompeians are with us, not in their suburban
villas, not in Rome, and, if some are still in Rome, they will soon go.
Meantime I shall not stay at Capua, but at Luceria, and of course I
shall abandon the coast at once. I shall wait for the move of Afranius
and Petreius: for Labienus is a

Ego pro Pompeio lubenter emori possum; facio pluris omnium hominum
neminem; sed non ita, non in eo iudico spem de salute rei publicae.
Significas enim aliquanto secus, quam solebas, ut etiam Italia, si
ille cedat, putes cedendum. Quod ego nec rei publicae puto esse utile
nec liberis meis, praeterea neque rectum neque honestum. Sed cur
"Poterisne igitur videre tyrannum?" Quasi intersit, audiam an videam,
aut locupletior mihi sit quaerendus auctor quam Socrates; qui, cum XXX
tyranni essent, pedem porta non extulit. Est mihi praeterea praecipua
causa manendi. De qua utinam aliquando tecum loquar!

man of little standing. You may say that I am too. I say nothing
of myself: I leave that to others. Who has standing here? All you
loyalists stay at home, and will continue to stay there. Who failed me
in the old days? Who supports me now in this war, as I must call it.

So far Vibullius' achievements have been fine. You will see that from
Pompey's letter. _Vide_ the passage marked.[60] You will see Vibullius'
own opinion of Pompey. My point is that I can gladly die for Pompey's
sake--there is no one I hold dearer; but not in that way. In him I
see no hope for the safety of the state. You express a view different
from your usual view, that I must even leave Italy, if he does. That
course seems to me of no advantage to the state or to my children, and,
moreover, neither right nor honourable. But why do you say, "Will you
be able to see a tyrant"? As if it mattered whether I hear of him or
see him, or as if I wanted a better example than Socrates, who never
set foot out of gate during the reign of the Thirty tyrants. Besides I
have a special reason for staying. I wish I could talk it over with you.

After writing this letter on the 17th, by the same lamp as that in
which I burned yours, I set out from Formiae to go to Pompey, and I may
be of use, if the talk is of peace: but, if of war, of what use shall I
be?

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Cales, Feb. 18_, B.C. _49_]

Upset by this grave and most calamitous crisis, though I have no
opportunity of consulting you personally, still I wish to enjoy your
advice. The whole question under debate is this. What do you think I
should do, if Pompey leaves Italy, as I expect he will? To help you to
a decision, I will briefly recount what occurs to me on both sides of
the question.

Not only Pompey's great services in bringing about my restoration and
his intimacy with me, but the public welfare, leads me to think that
my policy and his or, if you will, my fortunes and his should be one.
And another thing, if I remain in Italy and desert the company of
loyal and distinguished citizens, I must fall into the power of one
man, and, though he gives me many tokens of regard (and you know well
I took good care that it should be so with this crisis in view), yet
he still leaves me a twofold problem; how much trust can be put in his
promises, and, if I am positive of his good will, is it proper for a
man of courage and loyalty to remain in Rome and lose his position for
the future where he has enjoyed the highest distinctions and commands,
performed deeds of importance, been invested with the highest seat in
the sacred college, and to suffer risks and perhaps some shame, if ever
Pompey restore the constitution? So much for the arguments on one side.

Now look at those on the other. There is not an atom of prudence or
courage in Pompey's policy--and besides nothing that is not clean
contrary to my counsel and advice. I pass over the old grievance, how
Caesar was Pompey's man: Pompey raised him to

       *       *       *       *       *

aluit, auxit, armavit, ille legibus per vim et contra auspicia
ferendis auctor, ille Galliae ulterioris adiunctor, ille gener, ille
in adoptando P. Clodio augur, ille restituendi mei quam retinendi
studiosior, ille provinciae propagator, ille absentis in omnibus
adiutor, idem etiam tertio consulatu, postquam esse defensor rei
publicae coepit, contendit, ut decem tribuni pl. ferrent, ut absentis
ratio haberetur, quod idem ipse sanxit lege quadam sua, Marcoque
Marcello consuli finienti provincias Gallias Kalendarum Martiarum die
restitit--sed, ut haec omittam, quid foedius, quid perturbatius hoc ab
urbe discessu sive potius turpissima fuga? Quae condicio non accipienda
fuit potius quam relinquenda patria? Malae condiciones erant, fateor,
sed num quid hoc peius? At recuperabit rem publicam. Quando? aut quid
ad eam spem est parati? Non ager Picenus amissus? non patefactum iter
ad urbem? non pecunia omnis et publica et privata adversario tradita?
Denique nulla causa, nullae vires, nulla sedes, quo concurrent, qui rem
publicam defensam velint. Apulia delecta est, inanissima pars Italiae
et ab impetu huius belli remotissima; fuga et maritima opportunitas
visa quaeri desperatione. Invite cepi Capuam, non quo munus illud
defugerem, sed in ea causa, in qua nullus

place and military power, assisted him in passing laws by force
and despite bad omens, granted him Further Gaul in addition to his
province; Pompey married his daughter, Pompey was augur at the adoption
of Clodius; Pompey was more active in effecting my restoration than
in preventing my banishment; Pompey prolonged the tenure of Caesar's
provincial government; Pompey championed his cause in absence; and
again in his third consulship, when he began to be the defender of
the constitution, struggled to get the ten tribunes to propose a bill
admitting Caesar's candidature in absence; ratified that privilege by
a law of his own; and opposed M. Marcellus the consul, when Marcellus
would have concluded Caesar's government of the provinces of Gaul on
the 1st of March. Putting all this on one side, is not this departure
or rather this disgraceful and iniquitous flight from Rome a most
shameful sign of panic? Any compromise ought to have been accepted
in preference to abandoning our country. I admit the terms were bad,
but could anything be worse than this? If you say he will restore the
constitution, I ask you when and what preparation has been made to
that end? We have lost Picenum: the road lies open to Rome: the funds
of the state and of individuals have been delivered to our enemy.
Finally we have no policy, no forces, no rendezvous for patriots;
Apulia has been chosen, the least populous district in Italy and the
most removed from the brunt of this war, and clearly chosen in despair
for the opportunity of flight which the sea affords. With reluctance
I took charge of Capua, not that I would shirk the duty, but with the
reluctance which one would have in a

esset ordinum, nullus apertus privatorum dolor, bonorum autem esset
aliquis, sed hebes, ut solet, et, ut ipse sensissem, multitudo et
infimus quisque propensus in alteram partem, multi mutationis rerum
cupidi, dixi ipsi me nihil suscepturum sine praesidio et sine pecunia.
Itaque habui nihil omnino negotii, quod ab initio vidi nihil quaeri
praeter fugam. Eam si nunc sequor, quonam? Cum illo non; ad quem cum
essem profectus, cognovi in iis locis esse Caesarem, ut tuto Luceriam
venire non possem. Infero mari nobis incerto cursu hieme maxima
navigandum est. Age iam, cum fratre an sine eo cum filio? at quo modo?
In utraque enim re summa difficultas erit, summus animi dolor; qui
autem impetus illius erit in nos absentis fortunasque nostras! Acrior
quam in ceterorum, quod putabit fortasse in nobis violandis aliquid se
habere populare. Age iam, has compedes, fascis, inquam, hos laureatos
ecferre ex Italia quam molestum est! qui autem locus erit nobis tutus,
ut iam placatis utamur fluctibus, antequam ad illum venerimus? Qua
autem aut quo, nihil scimus. At, si restitero, et fuerit nobis in hac
parte locus, idem fecero quod in Cinnae dominatione L. Philippus, quod
L. Flaccus, quod Q. Mucius, quoquo modo ea res huic

cause in which neither ranks nor individuals had expressed any feeling,
though there was some feeling amongst the loyalists, sluggish as
usual. Besides, as I felt, the crowd and the dregs of the populace
were inclined to the other side, and many were merely desirous of
revolution. I told Pompey himself that I could undertake nothing
without a garrison and without funds. So I have had nothing at all to
do, since I saw from the first, that his only object was flight. If I
would share his flight, whither am I to go? With him I cannot go; for,
when I set out, I learned that Caesar was so posted that I could not
reach Luceria with safety. I should have to go by the Lower Sea[61]
in the depth of winter and with no certain destination. Moreover am
I to take my brother, or leave him and take my son? But how? Either
course would cause me the greatest trouble and the greatest grief: and
how he will wreak his rage on me and my property in my absence! More
vindictively perhaps than in the case of others, because he will think
that vengeance on me will please the people. Consider too my fetters,
I mean my laurelled fasces. How awkward it will be to take them out of
Italy! Suppose I enjoy a calm passage, what place will be safe for me
till I join Pompey? I have no idea of how or where to go. But, if I
stand my ground and find a place on Caesar's side, I shall follow the
example of L. Philippus under the tyranny of Cinna, of L. Flaccus and
of Q. Mucius.[62] Though it ended unfortunately

[61] I.e. the sea on the west coast of Italy as opposed to _mare
superum_, the Adriatic.

[62] All these persons stayed in Rome during the Cinnan revolution.
Mucius was put to death by the younger Marius in 82 B.C.

quidem cecidit; qui tamen ita dicere solebat, se id fore videre, quod
factum est, sed malle quam armatum ad patriae moenia accedere. Aliter
Thrasybulus et fortasse melius. Sed est certa quaedam illa Muci ratio
atque sententia, est illa etiam Philippi, et, cum sit necesse, servire
tempori et non amittere tempus, cum sit datum. Sed in hoc ipso habent
tamen idem fasces molestiam. Sit enim nobis amicus, quod incertum
est, sed sit; deferet triumphum. Non accipere vide ne periculosum
sit, accipere invidiosum ad bonos. "O rem," inquis, "difficilem et
inexplicabilem!" Atqui explicanda est. Quid enim fieri potest? Ac, ne
me existimaris ad manendum esse propensiorem, quod plura in eam partem
verba fecerim, potest fieri, quod fit in multis quaestionibus, ut res
verbosior haec fuerit, illa verior. Quam ob rem ut maxima de re aequo
animo deliberanti ita mihi des consilium velim. Navis et in Caieta est
parata nobis et Brundisi.

Sed ecce nuntii scribente me haec ipsa noctu in Caleno, ecce litterae
Caesarem ad Corfinium, Domitium Corfini cum firmo exercitu et pugnare
cupiente. Non puto etiam hoc Gnaeum nostrum commissurum, ut Domitium
relinquat; etsi Brundisium Scipionem cum cohortibus duabus praemiserat,
legionem Fausto conscriptam in Siciliam sibi placere a consule duci
scripserat ad consules. Sed turpe Domitium deserere erit implorantem
eius auxilium. Est quaedam spes mihi quidem non magna, sed in his locis
firma, Afranium in Pyrenaeo cum Trebonio pugnasse, pulsum Trebonium,
etiam Fabium tuum transisse cum

       *       *       *       *       *

                                Page 113

in the case of Q. Mucius, yet he was wont to say he foresaw the issue,
but preferred it to taking arms against his country. Thrasybulus took
the other and perhaps happier course. But Mucius' decision and views
were quite definite, and so were those of Philippus; that one might do
some time-serving, when it was necessary, but when one's time came, one
should not miss it. But, in that event, still my fasces are a nuisance.
I do not know if Caesar will be friendly; but suppose he is, he will
offer me a triumph. To refuse would damage my chances with Caesar, to
accept would annoy the loyalists. It is a hard and insoluble question;
and yet solve it I must. What else can I do? I have said most in favour
of staying in Italy: but do not infer that I have any particular
inclination towards so doing: it may be, as often happens, that there
are more words on one side and more worth on the other. Then please
give me your advice, counting me openminded on the important question.
There is a boat ready for me at Caieta and at Brundisium.

But, here are messengers arriving as I write this letter at night in
Cales; and here is a letter saying that Caesar has reached Corfinium
and that Domitius is there with a strong force anxious to fight. I do
not think that Pompey will go so far as to abandon Domitius, though he
sent Scipio ahead to Brundisium with two squadrons, and has informed
the consuls that he wants one of them to take the legion raised for
Faustus into Sicily. But it were base to desert Domitius, when he
entreats for help. There is some hope, small enough to my mind, but
favoured in this district, that Afranius has fought with Trebonius in
the Pyrenees and driven him back, and that your

cohortibus, summa autem Afranium cum magnis copiis adventare. Id si
est, in Italia fortasse manebitur. Ego autem, cum esset incertum iter
Caesaris, quod vel ad Capuam vel ad Luceriam iturus putabatur, Leptam
misi ad Pompeium et litteras; ipse, ne quo inciderem, reverti Formias.

Haec te scire volui scripsique sedatiore animo, quam proxime

friend Fabius too has gone over to Pompey with his squadrons: and high
hope, that Afranius is marching hither with large forces. If that is
true, we may stay in Italy. But since no one knows Caesar's route, as
he was supposed to be going towards Capua or Luceria, I am sending
Lepta to Pompey with a letter. Myself I return to Formiae for fear I
should stumble on anyone.

I count Dionysius your man rather than mine: for, though I was well
acquainted with his character, I held to your opinion of him rather
than to my own. The fellow has paid no respect even to your frequent
certificates of character, but has become arrogant in what he takes
for a fall in my fortune, though so far as human wit can avail, I will
steer my course onward with some skill. I never failed Dionysius in
respect or service, or in a good word for the despicable cad. Nay,
I preferred to have my opinion criticized by Quintus and people in
general rather than omit to praise the fellow; and, sooner than seek
another master for my boys, I took pains to give them private lessons
myself. Good God, what a letter I sent him: how full of respect and
affection! You would think that I was sending for Dicaearchus or
Aristoxenus and not for an arch-chatter-box useless as a teacher. He
has a good memory: he shall have reason to say that mine is better. He

case. I always say, "if possible," "if no previous engagement hinders

much a stranger. It is the height of ingratitude, and ingratitude
includes all sins. But enough and more than enough of this.

I have a boat ready. Still I wait for a letter from you, that I may

After I sent you a letter before daybreak on the 22nd about Dionysius,
on the evening of the same day came Dionysius himself. I cannot but
think that it was by your influence, though he is wont to repent of his

I did not tell you before, but I heard later, that, when he had got

After I had sealed that letter to you, which I wanted to dispatch
last night (I wrote it in the evening and did dispatch it), C. Sosius
the praetor came to Formiae to visit my neighbour, M'. Lepidus, whose
quaestor he was. He brought a copy of Pompey's letter to the consuls:
"I have received a dispatch from L. Domitius, dated the 17th of
February. I enclose a copy. Now without a word from me, I know you
realize of your own accord how important it is for the State that all
our forces should concentrate at one spot at the earliest possible
date. If you agree, endeavour to reach me at once, leaving Capua such
garrison as you may consider necessary."

The one act needed to crown Pompey's disgrace is the desertion of
Domitius. I don't agree with the universal opinion that he is sure to
help him. "Will he desert so distinguished a citizen as Domitius and
those with him, even though he has thirty cohorts at his command?"
Unless I am greatly mistaken he will desert him. He is incredibly
alarmed, and has no thought but flight; and you want me to go with him;
for I see what you think. Yes, I have a foe to flee from, but no friend
to follow. As for your praise of that remark of mine, which you quote
and call so memorable, that I would rather be conquered with Pompey
than conquer with Caesar, well, I would: but it must be with Pompey
my old hero or ideal. As to the Pompey of to-day, who flees before he
knows from whom he is running or where to run; who has betrayed us,
abandoned his country and deserted

What disgrace, and therefore what misery! For I feel disgrace to be
the crown of misery, or indeed the only real misery. Pompey treated
Caesar as his _protégé_, began suddenly to fear him, declined terms of
peace, made no preparation for war, quitted Rome, lost Picenum by his
own fault, got himself blocked in Apulia, went off to Greece without a
word, leaving us in ignorance of a plan so important and unusual. Then
all of a sudden Domitius' letter to Pompey and Pompey's letter to the
consuls. It seemed to me that the Right had flashed upon his gaze, and
that he, the old heroic Pompey, cried:

    "What subtle craft they will let them devise,
    And work their wiliest in my despite.
    The right is on my side."[67]

Epistulam meam quod pervulgatam scribis esse, non fero moleste,

et impendent, ut testatum esse velim, de pace quid senserim. Cum
autem ad eam hortarer eum praesertim hominem, non videbar ullo modo
facilius moturus, quam si id, quod eum hortarer, convenire eius
sapientiae dicerem. Eam si "admirabilem" dixi, cum eum ad salutem
patriae hortabar, non sum veritus, ne viderer adsentari, cui tali in
re lubenter me ad pedes abiecissem. Quod autem est "aliquid inpertias

haberem; eodemque pertinet, quod causam eius probo.

I am not upset at the circulation of my letter, indeed I myself let
many people take a copy. Considering what has happened and is likely to
happen, I want my views on peace published. And when I exhorted Caesar
of all men to seek peace, I had no readier argument than to say, that
peace became a man of his wisdom. If I spoke of his "admirable" wisdom,
seeing that I was urging him on to the salvation of our country, I was
not afraid of appearing to flatter him: in such a cause I would gladly
have cast myself at his feet. When I use the phrase "spare time," that
does not mean for the consideration of peace, but for the consideration
of myself and my obligations. As to my statement that I have taken no
part in the war, though the facts are evidence, I wrote it to give
greater weight to my advice and it was for the same reason that I
expressed approbation of his case.

But this is idle talk now: I only wish it had done some good. Why, I
should not object to the recital of my letter at a public meeting,
when Pompey himself, writing to Caesar, exhibited for public perusal a
letter containing the words "On account of your splendid achievements,"
(are they more splendid

so.) and when two men like you and S. Peducaeus are going to meet him
at the fifth milestone,--and at this moment to what course does he
pledge himself, what is he doing, what is he going to do? Surely his
belief in his rights will grow more vehement, when he sees you and
men like you not only in crowds, but with joy upon your faces. "What
harm in that," you ask? Not a bit, as far as you are concerned: but
still the outward signs of the distinction between genuine feeling and
pretence are all upset. I foresee some strange decrees of the Senate.
But my letter has been more frank than I intended.

I hope to be at Arpinum on the 28th, and then to visit my country
estates, I fear for the last time. Your policy, gentlemanly, but
not without a touch of caution suited to the times, has my sincere
approval. Lepidus, who has the pleasure of my company almost every day,
never liked the plan of quitting Italy: Tullus detested it: for letters
from him often reach me from other hands. However their views influence
me little: they have given fewer pledges to the state than I: but I am
strongly swayed by the weight of your opinion, which proposes a plan
for betterment in the future and security in the present. Is there a
more wretched spectacle than that of Caesar earning praise in the most
disgusting cause, and of Pompey earning blame in the most excellent:
of Caesar being regarded as the saviour of his enemies, and Pompey
as a traitor to his friends? Assuredly though I love Pompey, from
inclination and duty, still I cannot praise his failure to succour such
men. If it was fear,

it was most cowardly; if, as some think, he imagined that their
massacre would assist his cause, it was most iniquitous. But let us
pass over this, for remembrance adds to my sorrow.

On the evening of the 24th, Balbus the younger came to me, hurrying on
a secret errand to the consul Lentulus from Caesar with a letter, a
commission, and the promise of a province on condition of his returning
to Rome. I don't think that he can be talked over without a personal
interview. Balbus said that Caesar was most anxious to meet Pompey (I
believe it), and to get on good terms with him. This I do not believe
and I fear all his kindness is only a preparation for cruelty like
Cinna's. Balbus the elder writes to me that Caesar wants nothing better
than to live in safety under Pompey. I expect you will believe that.
But while I write this letter on the 25th of February, Pompey may have
reached Brundisium. He set out without baggage, and before his legions,
on the 19th from Luceria. But that bogy-man has terrible wariness,
speed and energy. The future is a riddle to me.

replied that he did not know where such money as he owned was: that
some creditors did not pay, that other debts were not yet due. He said
something about his wretched slaves that would prevent his

Quod me magno animi motu perturbatum putas, sum equidem, sed non tam
magno, quam tibi fortasse videor. Levatur enim omnis cura, cum aut
constitit consilium, aut cogitando nihil explicatur. Lamentari autem
licet illud quidem totos dies; sed vereor, ne, nihil cum proficiam,
etiam dedecori sim studiis ac litteris nostris. Consumo igitur omne
tempus considerans, quanta vis sit illius viri, quem nostris libris
satis diligenter, ut tibi quidem videmur, expressimus. Tenesne igitur
moderatorem illum rei publicae quo referre velimus omnia? Nam sic
quinto, ut opinor, in libro loquitur Scipio: "Ut enim gubernatori
cursus secundus, medico salus, imperatori victoria, sic huic moderatori
rei publicae beata civium vita proposita est, ut opibus firma, copiis
locuples, gloria ampla, virtute honesta sit. Huius enim operis maximi
inter homines atque optimi illum esse perfectorem volo." Hoc Gnaeus
noster cum antea numquam tum in hac causa minime cogitavit. Dominatio
quaesita ab utroque est, non id actum, beata et honesta civitas ut
esset. Nec vero ille urbem reliquit, quod eam tueri non posset, nec
Italiam, quod ea pelleretur, sed hoc a primo cogitavit, omnes terras,
omnia maria movere, reges barbaros incitare, gentes feras armatas in
Italiam

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Formiae, Feb. 27_, B.C. _49_]

As you suppose, I am in great anxiety of mind: but it is not so great
as you may imagine. I am rid of care, as soon as resolve is fixed
or thought proves futile. Still I may lament my lot as I do all day
long. But I fear, since lamentation is idle, I disgrace my philosophy
and my works. So I spend my time considering the character of the
ideal statesman, who is sketched clearly enough, you seem to think,
in my books on the Republic. You remember then the standard by which
our ideal governor was to weigh his acts. Here are Scipio's words,
in the 5th book, I think it is: "As a safe voyage is the aim of the
pilot, health of the physician, victory of the general, so the ideal
statesman will aim at happiness for the citizens of the state to give
them material security, copious wealth, wide-reaching distinction
and untarnished honour. This, the greatest and finest of human
achievements, I want him to perform." Pompey never had this notion
and least of all in the present cause. Absolute power is what he and
Caesar have sought; their aim has not been to secure the happiness and
honour of the community. Pompey has not abandoned Rome, because it was
impossible to defend, nor Italy on forced compulsion; but it was his
idea from the first to plunge the world into war, to stir up barbarous
princes, to bring savage tribes into

adducere, exercitus conficere maximos. Genus illud Sullani regni iam
pridem appetitur multis, qui una sunt, cupientibus. An censes nihil
inter eos convenire, nullam pactionem fieri potuisse? Hodie potest. Sed
neutri σκοπὸς est ille, ut nos beati simus; uterque regnare vult.

Haec a te invitatus breviter exposui. Voluisti enim me, quid, de his
mails sentirem, ostendere. Προθεσπίζω igitur, noster Attice, non
hariolans ut illa, cui nemo credidit, sed coniectura prospiciens:

"Iamque mari magno--"

non multo, inquam, secus possum vaticinari. Tanta malorum impendet
Ἰλιάς. Atque hoc nostra gravior est causa, qui domi sumus, quam
illorum, qui una transierunt, quod illi quidem alterum metuunt, nos
utrumque. "Cur igitur," inquis, "remansimus?" Vel tibi paruimus vel non
occurrimus, vel hoc fuit rectius. Conculcari, inquam, miseram Italiam
videbis proxima aestate aut utriusque in mancipiis ex omni genere
collectis, nec tam proscriptio pertimescenda, quae Luceriae multis
sermonibus denuntiata esse dicitur, quam universae rei p. interitus.
Tantas in confligendo utriusque vires video futuras. Habes coniecturam
meam. Tu autem consolationis fortasse aliquid exspectasti. Nihil
invenio, nihil fieri potest miserius, nihil perditius, nihil foedius.

Quod quaeris, quid Caesar ad me scripserit, quod saepe, gratissimum
sibi esse, quod quierim, oratque, in eo ut perseverem. Balbus minor
haec eadem mandata. Iter autem eius erat ad Lentulum consulem cum
litteris Caesaris praemiorumque promissis, si

                                Page 133

Italy under arms, and to gather a huge army. A sort of Sulla's reign
has long been his object, and is the desire of many of his companions.
Or do you think that no agreement, no compromise between him and Caesar
was possible? Why, it is possible to-day: but neither of them looks to
our happiness. Both want to be kings.

[Sidenote: Ennius, _Alexander_.]

At your request I have given an outline of my views; for you wanted an
expression of my opinion on these troubles. So I play the prophet, my
dear Atticus, not at random like Cassandra whom no one believed, but
with imaginative insight. "Now on the great sea" my prophecy runs like
the old tag: such an Iliad of woe hangs over us. The case of us, who
stay at home, is worse than that of those who have gone with Pompey,
for they have only one to fear, while we have both. You ask then, why
I stay. Well, in compliance with your request, or because I could not
meet Pompey on his departure, or because it was the more honourable
course. I say you will see poor Italy trodden down next summer or in
the hands of their slaves drawn from every quarter of the globe. It
will not be a proscription (in spite of the talk and threats we hear
of at Luceria) which we shall have to dread, but general destruction.
So huge are the forces that will join in the struggle. That is my
prophecy. Perhaps you looked for consolation. I see none: we have
reached the limit of misery, ruin and disgrace.

You inquire what Caesar said in his letter. The usual thing, that my
inaction pleases him, and he begs me to maintain it. Balbus the younger
brought the same message by word of mouth. Balbus was travelling to
Lentulus the consul with letters from Caesar, and

Q. Fabius came to me on the 10th of February. He announces that L.

Vibullius is on the march towards me; that he intended to leave
Corfinium on the 9th of February and that C. Hirrus with five cohorts
follows behind. I think you should come to me at Luceria, for here I

M. CICERO IMPERATOR GREETINGS TO CN. MAGNUS PROCONSUL.


[Sidenote: _Formiae, Feb. 16_, B.C. _49_]

On the 15th of February I got your letter at Formiae. I gather that
matters in Picenum were much more satisfactory than I had heard, and am
glad to learn of the bravery and energy of Vibullius.

So far I have stayed on this coast where I was given the command, but
I have kept a boat ready. For the news and my fears were such that I
felt I must follow any plan you should make. But now your influence
and your policy have encouraged me, I will stay in the coast districts
and Tarracina, if you think that the district can be held. The towns,
however, are without garrison, for there is no member of the Senate in
the district except M. Eppius, a man of foresight and energy, whom I
desired to stay at Menturnae. The gallant and influential L. Torquatus
is not at Formiae, but I fancy has set out to join you.

In entire accord with your latest instructions, I went to Capua on the
very day you left Teanum Sidicinum. For you had desired me to take
part with M. Considius the propraetor in looking after things there.
On arrival I found that T. Ampius was holding a levy with the greatest
energy, and that the troops raised were being taken over by Libo, a
local man of energy and influence. I stayed at Capua as long as the
consuls. Once again in accordance with instructions from the consuls
I went to Capua for the 5th of February. After a stay of three days I
returned to Formiae.

At the present moment I do not know what are your ideas and plan of
campaign. If you think that this coast should be held--and Capua has
a good position and is an important town, not to speak of its loyal
inhabitants, and to my mind tenable--a commander is wanted. If your
plan is concentration, I will come to you at once without hesitation.
Nothing would delight me more, and I told you so on the day of our
departure from Rome. I do not trouble about criticisms of inactivity
from anyone but yourself. If, as I foresee, war is inevitable, I feel I
can easily satisfy every criticism. I have sent my relative M. Tullius
in case you may wish to send a reply.

of your exceptional and continued zeal for the state to join me as

come with speed to Brundisium.

had no idea that the state's

causa mare transiturum eramque in spe magna fore ut in Italia possemus
aut concordiam constituere qua mihi nihil utilius videbatur, aut rem
publicam summa cum dignitate defendere. Interim nondum meis litteris
ad te perlatis ex iis mandatis, quae D. Laelio ad consules dederas,
certior tui consilii factus non exspectavi, dum mihi a te litterae
redderentur, confestimque cum Quinto fratre et cum liberis nostris
iter ad te in Apuliam facere coepi. Cum Teanum Sidicinum venissem,
C. Messius, familiaris tuus, mihi dixit aliique complures Caesarem
iter habere Capuam et eo ipso die mansurum esse Aeserniae, Sane sum
commotus, quod, si ita esset, non modo iter meum interclusum, sed
me ipsum plane exceptum putabam. Itaque tum Cales processi, ut ibi
potissimum consisterem, dum certum nobis ab Aesernia de eo, quod
audieram, referretur.

At mihi, cum Calibus essem, adfertur litterarum tuarum exemplum, quas
tu ad Lentulum consulem misisses. Hae scriptae sic erant, litteras tibi
a L. Domitio a. d. XIII Kal. Martias allatas esse (earumque exemplum
subscripseras); magnique interesse rei publicae scripseras omnes copias
primo quoque tempore in unum locum convenire, et ut, praesidio quod
satis esset, Capuae relinqueret. His ego litteris lectis in eadem
opinione fui qua reliqui omnes, te cum omnibus copiis ad Corfinium esse
venturum; quo mihi, cum Caesar ad oppidum castra haberet, tutum iter
esse non abritrabar.

Cum res in summa exspectatione esset, utrumque simul audivimus, et quae
Corfini acta essent, et te iter Brundisium facere coepisse; cumque nec
mihi nec fratri meo dubium esset, quin Brundisium contenderemus,

welfare would drive you to flight across the seas, and I had great
hopes that it might be in Italy we should either conclude peace
(the wisest course to my mind) or fight for the state with honour
untarnished. My letter cannot have reached you yet, but from the
message which you entrusted to D. Laelius for the consuls I learnt of
your plans. I did not wait for a reply to my letter, but forthwith
set out along with my brother Quintus and the children to join you in
Apulia. On arrival at Teanum Sidicinum I was told by your friend C.
Messius, and many other people, that Caesar was on his way to Capua,
and would bivouac that very day at Aesernia. I was really startled,
as it occurred to me, that, if that was so, my road was closed, and I
myself was quite captured. So I went to Cales, choosing that particular
place to stay at, till I should get certain news from Aesernia as to
the rumour I had heard.

At Cales I received a copy of your letter to Lentulus the consul.
Its purport was that you had got a letter (of which you subjoined a
copy) from L. Domitius on the 17th of February, and you considered it
of the greatest public importance to concentrate your forces on the
earliest possible occasion, and that a sufficient garrison should be
left at Capua. On the perusal of this dispatch I agreed with others in
supposing that you would come in full force to Corfinium. As Caesar was
encamped against the town, I considered the road thither was not safe
for me.

Anxiously awaiting news, I heard two reports at the same time: news
of the affair of Corfinium, and that you were coming to Brundisium.
Neither I nor my brother had any hesitation about starting for

       *       *       *       *       *

a multis, qui e Samnio Apuliaque veniebant, admoniti sumus, ut
caveremus, ne exciperemur a Caesare, quod is in eadem loca, quae
nos petebamus, profectus celerius etiam, quam nos possemus, eo, quo
intenderet, venturus esset. Quod cum ita esset, nec mihi nec fratri meo
nec cuiquam amicorum placuit committere, ut temeritas nostra non solum
nobis, sed etiam rei publicae noceret, cum praesertim non dubitaremus,
quin, si etiam tutum nobis iter fuisset, te tamen iam consequi non
possemus.

Interim accepimus tuas litteras Canusio a. d. X K. Martias datas,
quibus nos hortaris, ut celerius Brundisium veniamus. Quas cum
accepissemus a. d. III K. Martias, non dubitabamus, quin tu iam
Brundisium pervenisses, nobisque iter illud omnino interclusum
videbamus neque minus nos esse captos, quam qui Corfini fuissent. Neque
enim eos solos arbitrabamur capi, qui in armatorum manus incidissent,
sed ecs nihilo minus, qui regionibus exclusi intra praesidia atque
intra arma aliena venissent.

Quod cum ita sit, maxime vellem primum semper tecum fuissem; quod
quidem tibi ostenderam, cum a me Capuam reiciebam. Quod feci non
vitandi oneris causa, sed quod videbam teneri illam urbem sine exercitu
non posse, accidere autem mihi nolebam, quod doleo viris fortissimis
accidisse. Quoniam autem, tecum ut essem, non contigit, utinam tui
consilii certior factus essem! Nam suspicione adsequi non potui, quod
omnia prius arbitratus sum fore, quam ut haec rei publicae causa in
Italia non posset duce te consistere. Neque vero nunc consilium tuum
reprehendo, sed fortunam rei publicae lugeo nec, si

Brundisium, when many travellers from Samnium and Apulia warned us to
beware of capture, because Caesar had set out for the same destination,
and was likely to reach there quicker than ourselves. Under those
circumstances, I, my brother and our friends were reluctant to allow
any rashness of ours to damage the state as well as ourselves.
Moreover, we were sure that, even if our path were clear, we could not
overtake you.

Meanwhile I got a letter from you dated at Canusium, of the 20th of
February, in which you urged me to hasten to Brundisium. Receiving this
on the 27th, I felt confident you must have arrived at Brundisium,
and I saw that our road was quite cut off and we were as completely
captured as the people at Corfinium, for I do not only consider
captured those who fall into the hands of armed bands, but equally
those who, being shut off from a district, find themselves hedged
between a garrison and an enemy in the field.

This being so, my first and chiefest wish is that I had stayed with you
all the time. I showed you as much when I gave up command at Capua. I
did so, not to shirk my duty, but because I saw that the city could not
be held without troops, and I was reluctant to suffer the fate which I
am sorry to hear has befallen some very brave men. Since, however, I
have not had the fortune to be with you, would that I were acquainted
with your plans, for I cannot imagine them, having hitherto thought
that the last thing to happen would be that the national cause would
not hold its own in Italy under your leadership. I do not criticize
your plan, but I bewail the misfortunes of the state. If I cannot guess

ego, quid tu sis secutus, non perspicio, idcirco minus existimo te
nihil nisi summa ratione fecisse.

Mea quae semper fuerit sententia primum de pace vel iniqua condicione
retinenda, deinde de urbe (nam de Italia quidem nihil mihi umquam
ostenderas), meminisse te arbitror. Sed mihi non sumo, ut meum
consilium valere debuerit; secutus sum tuum neque id rei publicae

Ego me in hac omni causa facile intellegebam pugnandi cupidis hominibus
non satis facere. Primum enim prae me tuli me nihil malle quam pacem,
non quin eadem timerem quae illi, sed ea bello civili leviora ducebam.
Deinde suscepto bello, cum pacis condiciones ad te adferri a teque
ad eas honorifice et large responderi viderem, duxi meam rationem;
quam tibi facile me probaturum pro tuo in me beneficio arbitrabar.
Memineram me esse unum, qui pro meis maximis in rem publicam meritis
supplicia miserrima et crudelissima pertulissem, me esse unum, qui, si
offendissem eius animum, cui tum, cum iam in armis essemus, consulatus
tamen alter et triumphus amplissimus deferebatur, subicerer eisdem
proeliis, ut mea persona semper ad improborum civium impetus aliquid
videretur habere populare. Atque haec non ego prius sum suspicatus,
quam mihi palam denuntiata sunt, neque ea tam pertimui, si subeunda
essent, quam declinanda putavi, si honeste vitare possem. Quam brevem
illius temporis, dum in spe pax fuit,

policy, I still suppose that you have done nothing without cogent
reasons.

I think you remember that my vote has always been for peace, even on
poor terms, and secondly for holding the city. As to Italy you gave
me no inkling. I do not claim that my policy should have prevailed.
I followed yours, not indeed for the sake of the state, of which I
despaired and which even now lies in ruin and cannot be restored
without a most calamitous civil war, but I wanted you, I longed to be
with you, nor will I omit any opportunity that may occur of attaining
my wish.

In the whole of this crisis I was well aware that my policy of peace
did not please the advocates of war. In the first place I professed to
prefer peace above all things, not because I had not the same fears
as they had, but because I counted those fears of less moment than
intestine war. Then indeed, after war had begun, when I saw terms of
peace offered to you, and met by you in an honourable and generous way,
I began to consider what my own interests were. That line of conduct I
suppose your kindness will easily excuse. I remembered that I was the
one man of all others who had suffered most cruel misery and punishment
for the greatest services to the state; that I was the one man who, if
I had offended Caesar (Caesar to whom was offered even on the eve of
battle a second consulship and a princely triumph), would be subjected
to the same struggle as before; for a personal attack on me seems to be
always popular with the disloyal. This idea only came to me after open
threats. It was not persecution I feared, if it were inevitable, but I
thought I should seek any escape that honour could allow. There is an
outline

rationem nostram vides, reliqui facultatem res ademit. Iis autem,
quibus non satis facio, facile respondeo. Neque enim ego amicior C.
Caesari umquam fui quam illi neque illi amiciores rei publicae quam
ego. Hoc inter me et illos interest, quod, cum et illi cives optimi
sint, et ego ab ista laude non absim, ego condicionibus, quod idem te
intellexeram velle, illi armis disceptari maluerunt. Quae quoniam ratio
vicit, perficiam profecto, ut neque res publica civis a me animum neque
tu amici desideres.

of my policy while there was hope of peace; its fulfilment was cut
short by circumstances. I have an easy reply to my critics. I have
never been more friendly to Caesar than they, and they are not more
friendly to the state than I. The difference between them and me is
this: they are loyal citizens, and I too deserve the title, but I
wanted settlement on terms which I understood you also desired, and
they wanted settlement by arms. Since their policy has won, I will do
my best that the state may not find me fail in the duties of a citizen,
nor you in the duties of a friend.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Formiae, Febr. 28_, B.C. _49_]

I am even more troubled by inflammation of the eyes than I was before.
Still I prefer to dictate this letter, rather than let Gallus Fadius,
who has a sincere regard for us both, have no letter to give you.
Yesterday I wrote myself to the best of my ability a letter containing
prognostications, which I hope may prove false. One excuse for the
present missive is my desire to let no day pass without communicating
with you, but there is a still more reasonable excuse, to beg you to
devote a little time to my case, and, as it will be a short business,
I hope you will explain your view thoroughly and make it quite
intelligible to me.

I have not committed myself at all. There has been no omission on my
part for which I cannot give not merely a plausible but a reasonable
excuse. Assuredly I was not guilty of any fault, when, to avoid

imparatam Capuam non solum ignaviae dedecus, sed etiam perfidiae
suspicionem fugiens accipere nolui, neque cum post condiciones pacis
per L. Caesarem et L. Fabatum allatas cavi, ne animum eius offenderem,
cui Pompeius iam armatus armato consulatum triumphumque deferret. Nec
vero haec extrema quisquam potest iure reprehendere, quod mare non
transierim. Id enim, etsi erat deliberationis, tamen obire non potui.
Neque enim suspicari debui, praesertim cum ex ipsius Pompei litteris,
idem quod video te existimasse, non dubitarim, quin is Domitio
subventurus esset, et plane, quid rectum et quid faciendum mihi esset,
diutius cogitare malui.

Primum igitur, haec qualia tibi esse videantur, etsi significata sunt
a te, tamen accuratius mihi perscribas velim, deinde aliquid etiam in
posterum prospicias fingasque, quem me esse deceat, et ubi me plurimum
prodesse rei publicae sentias, ecquae pacifica persona desideretur an
in bellatore sint omnia.

Atque ego, qui omnia officio metior, recordor tamen tua consilia;
quibus si paruissem, tristitiam illorum temporum non subissem. Memini,
quid mihi tum suaseris per Theophanem, per Culleonem, idque saepe
ingemiscens sum recordatus. Quare nunc saltem ad illos calculos
revertamur, quos tum abiecimus, ut non solum gloriosis consiliis
utamur, sed etiam paulo salubrioribus. Sed nihil praescribo; accurate
velim perscribas tuam ad me sententiam. Volo etiam exquiras, quam
diligentissime poteris

blame for cowardice and the charge of treachery to boot, I refused to
take over Capua in its unprepared state. Nor am I to blame, when, after
L. Caesar and L. Fabatus had brought terms of peace, I took precautions
not to incur the enmity of a man to whom Pompey was offering the
consulship and a triumph, when both were under arms. Finally I cannot
rightly be called to account for not crossing the sea: for, though that
was a course which was worthy of consideration, still I could not keep
Pompey's appointment. Nor could I guess his policy, especially as from
his own letter, as I see you inferred, I had no idea that he would fail
to relieve Domitius. And certainly I wanted time to consider what was
right and what I ought to do.

Firstly, then, I wish you would write me a careful account of your
views, though you have already outlined them, and secondly that you
would glance at the future, and give me an idea of what course you
think would become me, where you suppose I can serve the state best,
and whether the part of a man of peace is required at all, or whether
everything depends on a fighter.

And I, who test everything by the standard of duty, yet remember
your advice. Had I followed it, I should have been saved from the
wretchedness of that crisis in my life. I call to mind the counsel
you sent me then by Theophanes and Culleo, and the memory of it often
makes me groan. So let me now at last go over the old reckoning which
then I cast aside, to the end that I may follow a plan, which has in
view not only glory, but also some measure of safety. However, I make
no conditions: please give me your candid opinion. And please use your
best energies to

Ego, quod existimabam dispersos nos neque rei publicae utiles neque

primum uti ipse cum omni copia ad nos veniret; si de se dubitaret, ut

inquire (for you have suitable agents) what our friend Lentulus and
what Domitius is doing, what they intend to do, what is their present
attitude, whether they blame or are annoyed with anyone--why do I say
anyone?--I mean Pompey. Pompey does not hesitate to put the whole blame
on Domitius, as can be inferred from his letter, of which I send you

kindly send me that volume _On Concord_, by Demetrius of Magnesia,

CN. MAGNUS PROCONSUL SENDS GREETING TO THE CONSULS C. MARCELLUS AND L.
LENTULUS.


[Sidenote: _Luceria, Feb. 17 or 18_, B.C. _49_]

As I considered that with divided forces we could be of no service to
the state and no protection to one another, I sent a dispatch to L.
Domitius to come to me at once with all his forces, and that, if he was
dubious about himself, he should send me the nineteen cohorts, which
as a matter of fact were on the march to me from Picenum. My fears
have been realized. Domitius has been trapped and is not strong enough
himself to pitch a camp, because he has my nineteen and his own twelve
cohorts scattered in three towns (for some he has stationed at Alba and
some at Sulmo), and he is unable to free himself even if he wished.

I must inform you that this has caused me the greatest anxiety. I am
anxious to free men so numerous and of such importance from the danger
of a siege, and I cannot go to their assistance, because I do not think
that I can trust these two

non puto esse committendum, ut illuc ducantur, ex quibus tamen non
amplius XIIII cohortes contrahere potui, quod duas Brundisium misi
neque Canusium sine praesidio, dum abessem, putavi esse dimittendum.

D. Laelio mandaram, quod maiores copias sperabam nos habituros, ut, si
vobis videretur, alter uter vestrum ad me veniret, alter in Siciliam
cum ea copia, quam Capuae et circum Capuam comparastis, et cum iis
militibus, quos Faustus legit, proficisceretur, Domitius cum XII
suis cohortibus eodem adiungeretur, reliquae copiae omnes Brundisium
cogerentur et inde navibus Dyrrachium transportarentur. Nunc, cum hoc
tempore nihilo magis ego quam vos subsidio Domitio ire possim, ...
se per montes explicare non est nobis committendum, ut ad has XIIII
cohortes, quas dubio animo habeo, hostis accedere aut in itinere me
consequi possit.

Quam ob rem placitum est mihi (talia video[71] censeri M. Marcello
et ceteris nostri ordinis, qui hic sunt), ut Brundisium ducerem hanc
copiam, quam mecum habeo. Vos hortor, ut, quodcumque militum contrahere
poteritis, contrahatis et eodem Brundisium veniatis quam primum. Arma
quae ad me missuri eratis, iis censeo armetis milites, quos vobiscum
habetis. Quae arma superabunt, ea si Brundisium iumentis deportaritis,
vehementer rei publicae profueritis. De hac re velim nostros certiores
faciatis. Ego ad P. Lupum et C. Coponium praetores misi, ut se vobis
coniungerent, et militum quod haberent ad vos deducerent.

legions to march to that place: moreover I have not been able to bring
together more than fourteen cohorts of them, because two were sent
to Brundisium, and Canusium to my mind could not be left without a
garrison in my absence.

Hoping to collect larger forces I instructed D. Laelius, that with your
approval one of you should come to me, and the other set out for Sicily
with the force you have collected at Capua and in the neighbourhood,
and with Faustus' recruits; that Domitius with his twelve cohorts
should join up, and all the other troops should concentrate at
Brundisium, and from thence be taken by sea to Dyrrachium. Now,
since at the present time I am no more able than yourselves to go to
Domitius' assistance [and it remains for him][72] to extricate himself
by the mountain route, I must take steps that the enemy may not meet my
fourteen doubtful cohorts or overtake me on the march.

[72] Some words appear to be missing here.

Accordingly--and I see M. Marcellus and other members of the House
who are here approve--I am resolved to lead my present forces to
Brundisium. You I urge to concentrate all the forces you can and to
come with them to Brundisium at the first opportunity. I consider that
the arms which you meant to send to me should be used to arm your
troops. If you will have the remaining arms carted to Brundisium, you
will have done the state great service. Please give these instructions
to my supporters. I am sending word to the praetors, P. Lupus and C.
Coponius, to join you with whatever soldiery they have.

GREETINGS FROM CN. MAGNUS PROCONSUL TO L. DOMITIUS PROCONSUL.


[Sidenote: _Luceria, Feb. 11 or 12_, B.C. _49_]

I am greatly astonished that you send me no letters, and that I am kept
informed of the political situation by others rather than yourself.
With divided forces we cannot hope to cope with the enemy: united, I
trust we may do something for the safety of our country. Wherefore,
as you had arranged, according to Vibullius' letter, to start with
your army from Corfinium on the 9th of February and to come to me, I
wonder what reason there has been for your change of plan. The reason
mentioned by Vibullius is trivial, namely that you were delayed on
hearing that Caesar had left Firmum and arrived at Castrum Truentinum.
For the nearer our enemy begins to approach, the quicker you ought to
have joined forces with me, before Caesar could obstruct your march or
cut me off from you.

Wherefore again and again I entreat and exhort you--as I did in my
previous letter--to come to Luceria on the first possible day, before
the forces which Caesar has begun to collect can concentrate and divide
us. But, if people try to keep you back to protect their country seats,
I must ask you to dispatch to me the cohorts, which have come from
Picenum and Camerinum abandoning their own interests.

CN. MAGNUS PROCONSUL SENDS GREETING TO L. DOMITIUS PROCONSUL.


[Sidenote: _Luceria, Feb. 16_, B.C. _49_]

M. Calenius has brought me a letter from you dated the 16th of
February, in which you express the intention of watching Caesar and
hurrying to join me in Samnium, if he shall begin to march against me
along the coast: but, if he linger in your neighbourhood, you say you
wish to oppose his nearer advance.

To my mind your policy is ambitious and brave, but we must take great
care that, if divided, we may not be outmatched by the enemy, since
Caesar has numerous troops and in a short time will have more. A man
of your judgement ought to bear in mind not only the size of Caesar's
present array against you but the number of infantry and cavalry that
he will soon collect. Evidence of that contingency is in the letter
which Bussenius dispatched to me, and it agrees with the missives from
others in stating that Curio is concentrating the garrisons which were
in Umbria and Etruria and marching to join Caesar. With these forces
combined, though one division may be sent to Alba, and another advance
on you, and though Caesar may refrain from the offensive and be content
to defend his position, still you will be in a fix, nor will you be
able with your following to make sufficient head against such numbers
to allow of your sending out foraging parties.

Therefore I beg you earnestly to come here on the first opportunity
with all your forces. The consuls have decided to do the same. I have
instructed

mandata dedi providendum esse, ne duae legiones sine Picentinis
cohortibus in conspectum Caesaris committerentur. Quam ob rem nolito
commoveri, si audieris me regredi, si forte Caesar ad me veniet;
cavendum enim puto esse, ne implicatus haeream. Nam neque castra
propter anni tempus et militum animos facere possum, neque ex omnibus
oppidis contrahere copias expedit, ne receptum amittam. Itaque non
amplius xiiii cohortes Luceriam coegi. Consules praesidia omnia
deducturi sunt aut in Siciliam ituri. Nam aut exercitum firmum habere
oportet, quo confidamus perrumpere nos posse, aut regiones eius modi
obtinere, e quibus repugnemus; id quod neutrum nobis hoc tempore
contigit, quod et magnam partem Italiae Caesar occupavit, et nos non
habemus exercitum tam amplum neque tam magnum quam ille. Itaque nobis
providendum est, ut summam rei publicae rationem habeamus. Etiam
atque etiam te hortor, ut cum omni copia quam primum ad me venias.
Possumus etiam nunc rem publicam erigere, si communi consilio negotium
administrabimus; si distrahemur, infirmi erimus. Mihi hoc constitutum

M. Tuscilius to tell you that we must beware lest the two legions
without the cohorts from Picenum come within sight of Caesar.
Accordingly do not be disturbed if you hear of my retreat in the face
of Caesar's possible advance, for I consider that I must take every
step to avoid being trapped. The season of the year and the spirit of
my troops prevents me from making a camp; nor is it wise to collect the
garrisons from all the towns, lest room for retreat be lost. So I have
not mustered more than fourteen cohorts at Luceria. The consuls will
bring in all their garrisons to me or start for Sicily. We must either
have an army strong enough to allow of our breaking through the enemy's
lines, or get and hold localities we can defend. At the present moment
we have neither of those advantages: a large part of Italy is held by
Caesar, and our army is neither so well equipped nor so large as his.
We must therefore take care to look to the main issue. Again and again
I beg you to come to me as soon as possible with all your forces. Even

Quare da operam, si ulla ratione etiam nunc efficere potes, ut te

happened: he refuses to meet you in the field at present, and he is
hemming you in with all his forces concentrated, so that the road may
not be clear for you to join me and unite your loyal contingent with
my legions whose allegiance is questionable. Consequently I am all the
more upset by your dispatch: for I cannot place sufficient confidence
in the loyalty of my men to risk a decisive engagement, nor have the
levies recruited for the consuls come here.

So do your best, if any tactics can extricate you even now, to join me
as soon as possible before our enemy can concentrate all his forces.
The levies cannot reach here at an early date, and, even if they were
concentrated, you must see how little trust can be put in troops, which
do not even know one another by sight, when facing a veteran army.

Let my secretary's handwriting be proof that I am suffering from
inflammation of the eyes, and that is my reason for brevity, though now
to be sure I have no news. I depend entirely on news from Brundisium.
If Caesar has come up with our friend Pompey, there is some slight hope
of peace: but, if Pompey has crossed the sea, we must look for war and
massacre. Do you see the kind of man into whose hands the state has
fallen? What foresight, what energy, what readiness! Upon my word, if
he refrain from murder and rapine, he will be the darling of those who
dreaded him most. The people of the country towns and the farmers talk
to me a great deal. They care for nothing at all

I have no doubt my daily letter must bore you, especially as I have no
fresh news, nor can I find any new excuse for a letter. If I should
employ special messengers to convey my chatter to you without reason,
I should be a fool: but I cannot refrain from entrusting letters to
folk who are bound for Rome, especially when they are members of my
household. Believe me, too, when I seem to talk with you, I have some
little relief from sorrow, and, when I read a letter from you, far
greater relief. I am quite aware that there has been no time, since
fear drove me to flight, when silence and no letters would have been
more appropriate, for the good reason that there is no fresh news at
Rome, nor here--two or three days' journey nearer Brundisium. The issue
of this first campaign will turn entirely on the action at Brundisium:
and I am on thorns to hear the result. However, all will be known by
the 7th. On the noon of the day (that is the 21st of February), on the
morning of which Pompey left Canusium, I see that Caesar set out from
Corfinium. But Caesar marches in such a way, and so spurs his men with
largess, that I fear he may reach Brundisium sooner than we

opus sit, accesserit. Dices: "Quid igitur proficis, qui anticipes
eius rei molestiam, quam triduo sciturus sis?" Nihil equidem; sed,
ut supra dixi, tecum perlibenter loquor, et simul scito labare meum
consilium illud, quod satis iam fixum videbatur. Non mihi satis idonei
sunt auctores ii, qui a te probantur. Quod enim umquam eorum in re
publica forte factum exstitit? aut quis ab iis ullam rem laude dignam
desiderat? Nec mehercule laudandos existimo, qui trans mare belli
parandi causa profecti sunt. Quamquam haec ferenda non erant. Video
enim, quantum id bellum et quam pestiferum futurum sit. Sed me movet
unus vir; cuius fugientis comes, rem publicam recuperantis socius
videor esse debere. "Totiensne igitur sententiam mutas?" Ego tecum
tamquam mecum loquor. Quis autem est, tanta quidem de re quin varie
secum ipse disputet? simul et elicere cupio sententiam tuam, si manet,
ut firmior sim, si mutata est, ut tibi adsentiar. Omnino ad id, de
quo dubito, pertinet me scire, quid Domitius acturus sit, quid noster
Lentulus.

De Domitio varia audimus, modo esse in Tiburti haut lepide, modo cum
Lepidis[74] accessisse ad urbem, quod item falsum video esse. Ait enim
Lepidus eum nescio quo penetrasse itineribus occultis occultandi sui
causa an maris apiscendi, ne is quidem scit. Ignorat etiam de filio.
Addit illud sane molestum, pecuniam Domitio satis grandem, quam is
Corfini habuerit, non esse redditam. De Lentulo autem nihil audimus.
Haec velim exquiras ad meque perscribas.

want. You may wonder why I forestall disagreeable tidings which will be
known in three days' time. I have no reason, except, as I said before,
that I love to talk to you; and at the same time I want you to know
that what I had counted my fixed resolve is shaken. The precedents you
quote with approval don't quite fit my case. They are those of men who
have never distinguished themselves by great political action, and
are not looked up to for any act of merit. Nor, let me tell you, have
I any praise for those who have crossed the sea to make preparations
for war--unbearable as things here were. For I foresee how great and
calamitous that war will be. I am influenced only by one man, whom
I think I ought to accompany in flight, and help in the restoration
of the constitution. I may seem variable; but I talk with you as I
talk with myself, and there is no one who, in such a crisis, does not
view matters in many lights. Moreover, I want to get your opinion,
to encourage me, if you have not changed it, or otherwise to win my
assent. It is particularly necessary for me to know in my dilemma what
course Domitius and my friend Lentulus will take.

As for Domitius I hear many reports: at one time that he is at Tibur
out of sorts, at another that he has consorted with the Lepidi in
their march to Rome. That I see is untrue. For Lepidus says that he
is following a hidden path, but whether to hide or reach the sea even
he does not know. Lepidus has no news about his son either. He adds a
provoking detail, that Domitius has failed to get back a large sum of
money which he had at Corfinium. Of Lentulus I have no news. Please
make inquiries on these points and inform me.

On the 3rd of March Aegypta[77] brought me your letters, one an old
one dated February 26, which you say you handed to Pinarius, whom I
have not seen. In that letter you were waiting to hear the result of
Vibullius' advance mission. He did not meet Caesar at all, as I see
from your second letter you are aware. You also wanted to know how I
shall receive Caesar on his return. I intend to shun him altogether.
And you contemplate flight on the day he comes, and a change in your
life, which I agree is politic. You wrote too that you do not know
if Domitius keeps his fasces. When you do know, please tell me. That
settles the first letter.

[77] A slave of Cicero's.

There follow two more dated the 28th of February, which hurled me from
my old position, when I was already tottering, as I had informed you.
I am not upset by your phrase "angry with almighty God."[78] There
is danger not only in Pompey's anger, but in Caesar's, and the issue
is doubtful, though to me the worst cause seems better equipped. Nor
am I influenced by the consuls, who themselves are more easily moved
than leaf or feather. It is consideration of my duty that tortures me
and has been torturing me all along. To remain in Italy is certainly
safer: to cross the sea the path of honour. Sometimes I prefer that
many should accuse me of rashness, rather than the select few of
dishonourable action. For your query about Lepidus and Tullus, they have

[78] This probably means that Pompey had said he would be angry with
every one who did not leave Rome, even with Jupiter.

Recentissima tua est epistula Kal. data, in qua optas congressum

congressuros nec, si congressi essent, Pompeium ad ullam condicionem
accessurum putabam. Quod videris non dubitare, si consules transeant,
quid nos facere oporteat, certe transeunt vel, quo modo nunc est,
transierunt. Sed memento praeter Appium neminem esse fere, qui non ius

Sufenas, Fannius, Voconius, Sestius, ipsi consules, quibus more maiorum
concessum est vel omnes adire provincias, aut legati sunt eorum. Sed

decided to meet Caesar and to take their seats in the House.

In your last letter, dated the 1st of March, you long for a meeting
between the two leaders, and have hopes of peace. But at the time of
writing I fancy they will not meet, and that, if they do, Pompey will
not agree to any terms. You seem to have no doubt as to what I ought
to do, if the consuls go over-seas; well they will go, or rather have
now gone. But bear in mind that of their number it is practically only
Appius who has not a right to cross. The rest are either invested
with military power, like Pompey, Scipio, Sufenas, Fannius, Voconius,
Sestius and the consuls themselves, who by old custom may visit all the
provinces; or else they are legates. However I have no positive views.
I know what you approve and pretty well what it is right to do.

My letter would be longer, if I could write myself. I fancy I shall
be able in two days' time. I have had Cornelius Balbus' letter, which
I received on the same day as yours, copied, and I forward it to you,
that you may sympathize with me on seeing me mocked.

I beg you, Cicero, to consider a plan eminently suited to your
character, namely to recall Caesar and Pompey to their former state of
friendship, which has been broken by the treachery of others. Believe
me that Caesar will not only meet your wishes, but will esteem any
endeavours of yours in this matter as a very great service. I wish
Pompey would take the same

idem Pompeius faciat. Qui ut adduci tali tempore ad ullam condicionem
possit, magis opto quam spero. Sed, cum constiterit et timere desierit,
tum incipiam non desperare tuam auctoritatem plurimum apud eum
valituram.

Quod Lentulum consulem meum voluisti hic remanere, Caesari gratum,
mihi vero gratissimum medius fidius fecisti. Nam illum tanti facio,
ut non Caesarem magis diligam. Qui si passus esset nos secum,
ut consueveramus, loqui et non se totum etiam ab sermone nostro
avertisset, minus miser, quam sum, essem. Nam cave putes hoc tempore
plus me quemquam cruciari, quod eum, quem ante me diligo, video in
consulatu quidvis potius esse quam consulem. Quodsi voluerit tibi
obtemperare et nobis de Caesare credere et consulatum reliquum Romae
peragere, incipiam sperare etiam consilio senatus auctore te, illo
relatore Pompeium et Caesarem coniungi posse. Quod si factum erit, me
satis vixisse putabo.

Factum Caesaris de Corfinio totum te probaturum scio: et, quo modo in
eius modi re, commodius cadere non potuit, quam ut res sine sanguine
confieret. Balbi mei tuique adventu delectatum te valde gaudeo. Is

view; but it is rather a dream of mine than a hope, that he can be
persuaded to come to terms at this time. When he becomes settled and
recovers from fright, I shall have better hopes that your influence may
avail with him.

In desiring my friend the consul Lentulus to remain in Rome, you have
gratified Caesar, and myself too, I may assure you, in the highest
degree. I value Lentulus as much as Caesar. If he had allowed me
to renew my old intercourse, and had not again and again avoided
conversation with me, I should be less unhappy than I am. For do not
think that this crisis causes anyone more torment than it causes me,
when I see him, to whom I am more devoted than to myself, acting in
office in a way quite unfitted for a consul. If he only takes your
advice and believes our professions about Caesar, and serves the
remainder of his office in Rome, then I shall begin to hope that by
the advice of the Senate, on your suggestion and at his formal motion,
there may be effected a reconciliation between Pompey and Caesar. In
that event I shall think my life's mission accomplished.

I know that you will approve entirely of Caesar's action about
Corfinium. Under the circumstances there could have been nothing
better than a settlement without bloodshed. I am delighted that you
are pleased with the arrival of my and your Balbus. Whatever Balbus
has told you about Caesar, and whatever Caesar has said to you in his
letters, I am confident Caesar will convince you by his acts, be his
fortune what it will, that his professions were quite sincere.

I have made provision for everything except a secret and safe passage
to the Adriatic. The other route I cannot face at this time of the
year. How can I get to that place on which my mind is set, and whither
fate calls? My departure must be in haste, for fear some obstacle and
hindrance should arise. It is not, as one might think, Pompey who
induces me to go. I have long known him to be the poorest of statesmen,
and I now see he is the poorest of generals. I am not induced by him,
but by the common talk of which Philotimus informs me. He says that the
loyalists are tearing me to tatters. Loyalists, good God! And see how
they are running to meet Caesar, and selling themselves to him. The
country towns are treating him as a god, and there is no pretence about
it, as there was in the prayers for Pompey's recovery from illness.
Any mischief this Pisistratus may leave undone will give as much
satisfaction as if he had prevented another from doing it. People hope
to placate Caesar; they think that Pompey is angered. What ovations
from the towns and what honour is paid him! In fright I dare say, but
they are more afraid of Pompey. They are delighted with the cunning
kindness of Caesar, and afraid of the anger of his rival. Those who are
on the jury list of 360 judges, the especial partisans of Pompey, some
of whom I see daily, shudder at vague Lucerias[79] which they conjure
up. So I ask what sort of loyalists are

"I fear the Trojans." Yet I see clearly with what a prospect I set out,
and I join myself with a man ready to devastate our country rather than
to conquer its oppressor, and I look to serve a tyrant. And indeed on
March 4, the date of this letter, I am expecting every moment some
news from Brundisium. Why do I say "some news," when it is news of his
disgraceful flight, and the route by which the victor is returning and
the direction in which he is moving. On hearing that, I think of going
to Arpinum, if Caesar comes by the Appian way.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Formiae, March 6_, B.C. _49_]

Although, when you read this letter, I think I shall know what has
been done at Brundisium, since Pompey left Canusium on the 21st of
February and I am writing this on the 6th of March, fourteen days after
his departure from Canusium, still I am in agonies of suspense as to
what each hour may bring, and I am astonished that I do not even get
a rumour. There is a strange hush. But perhaps this is much ado about
nothing, when we must know all about it soon enough. But it does worry
me that so far I have been unable to discover the whereabouts of my
friend Lentulus and of Domitius. I want to know, that I may be able to
find out what they are going to do, whether they are going to Pompey,
and, if so, by what route and on what date.

Town, I am told, is now crammed full with our party. Sosius and Lupus,
who, Pompey thought, would reach Brundisium before himself, are, it
appears, sitting as magistrates. From here there is a general move:
even M'. Lepidus, with whom I used to spend the day, thinks of starting
to-morrow. I am lingering in my villa at Formiae to get news the
sooner. Then I intend to go to Arpinum: from Arpinum I proceed to the
Adriatic, choosing the least frequented route and leaving behind or
even dismissing my lictors. For I am told that certain

et saepe antea magno praesidio rei publicae fuerunt, hanc cunctationem
nostram non probari multaque in me et severe in conviviis tempestivis
quidem disputari.

Cedamus igitur et, ut boni cives simus, bellum Italiae terra marique
inferamus et odia improborum rursus in nos, quae iam exstincta erant,
incendamus et Luccei consilia ac Theophani persequamur. Nam Scipio vel
in Syriam proficiscitur sorte vel cum genero honeste vel Caesarem fugit
iratum. Marcelli quidem, nisi gladium Caesaris timuissent, manerent.
Appius est eodem in timore et inimicitiarum recentium etiam. Praeter
hunc et C. Cassium reliqui legati, Faustus pro quaestore; ego unus,
cui utrumvis licet. Frater accedit, quem socium huius fortunae esse
non erat aequum. Cui magis etiam Caesar irascetur, sed impetrare non
possum, ut mancat. Dabimus hoc Pompeio, quod debemus. Nam me quidem
alius nemo movet, non sermo bonorum, qui nulli sunt, non causa quae
acta timide est, agetur improbe. Uni, uni hoc damus ne id quidem
roganti nec suam causam, ut ait, agenti, sed publicam. Tu quid cogites

loyalists, who now and formerly have been a bulwark of the Republic, do
not like my staying in Italy, and that they sit half the day over their
festive boards making caustic remarks about me.

So I must depart, and, to be a good citizen, wage war on Italy, kindle
against myself again the hatred of the disloyal which had died down,
and follow the plans of Lucceius and Theophanes. For Scipio can be
said to set out for Syria, his allotted province, or to accompany his
son-in-law, which is an honourable excuse, or to flee from Caesar's
anger. The Marcelli would of course have stayed, had they not feared
the sword of Caesar. Appius has the same reason for alarm, and
additional reason through a fresh quarrel. Except Appius and C. Cassius
all the others hold military commands, Faustus being proquaestor. I
am the only one who could go or stay as I like. Besides there is my
brother, whom it is not fair to involve in my trouble. With him Caesar
will be even more angry, but I cannot induce him to stay behind. This
sacrifice I will make to Pompey, as loyalty bids. For no one else
influences me, neither talk of loyalists--for there are none--nor our
cause, which has been conducted in panic and will be conducted in
disgrace. To one man, one only, I make this sacrifice, though he does
not even ask it and though the battle he is fighting is, as he says,
not his own but the State's, I should much like to know what you think
about crossing into Epirus.

from you, still I suppose I ought to answer the shorter note, which you
sent on the 4th on the eve of your attack. You say you are glad that I
have stayed in Italy, and you write that you abide by your former view.
But an earlier letter led me to think you had no doubt I ought to go,
if Pompey embarked with a good following and the consuls crossed too.
Have you forgotten this, or have I failed to understand you, or have
you changed your mind? But I shall either learn your opinion from the
letter I now await: or I shall extract another letter from you. From
Brundisium so far there is no news.

What a difficult and calamitous business! Nothing passed over in the
advice you give, nothing revealed as to your real opinion! You are glad
that I am not with Pompey, and yet you lay down how wrong it would
be for me to be present when he is criticized: it were shameful to
approve his conduct. Agreed. Should I then speak against him? "Heaven
forbid," you say. So, what can happen, if one way lies crime, and the
other punishment? You advise me to get from Caesar leave of absence
and permission to retire. Must I then beg and pray? That would be
humiliating: and suppose I fail? You say the matter of my triumph will
not be prejudiced. But what if I am hampered by that very thing? Accept
it? What dishonour! Refuse it? Caesar will think that I am repudiating
him entirely, more even than when I declined a place among his twenty
land commissioners.[81] And it is his way, when he excuses himself

conferre omnem illorum temporum culpam. Ita me sibi fuisse inimicum, ut
ne honorem quidem a se accipere vellem. Quanto nunc hoc idem accipiet
asperius! Tanto scilicet, quanto et honor hic illo est amplior et ipse
robustior. Nam, quod negas te dubitare, quin magna in offensa sim apud
Pompeium hoc tempore, non video causam, cur ita sit hoc quidem tempore.
Qui enim amisso Corfinio denique certiorem me sui consilii fecit, is
queretur Brundisium me non venisse, cum inter me et Brundisium Caesar
esset? Deinde etiam scit ἀπαρρησίαστον esse in ea causa querelam suam.
Me putat de municipiorum imbecillitate, de dilectibus, de pace, de
urbe, de pecunia, de Piceno occupando plus vidisse quam se. Sin, cum

noceat (quid enim faciet?

sed quia ingrati animi crimen horreo. Confido igitur adventum nostrum

hic potest se gerere non perdite? Vetant vita,[82] mores, ante facta,

to throw on me all the blame for that period, and to say I was so
bitter an enemy that I would not even take an office from him. How much
more will this annoy him! Why, as much more as this honour is greater
than that, and he himself is stronger. As for your remark that you
have no doubt I am in bad odour with Pompey at this present time, I
see no reason why it should be so, especially at this time. Pompey did
not tell me his plans till after the loss of Corfinium, and he cannot
complain of my not going to Brundisium, when Caesar was between me and
Brundisium. Besides he knows that complaint on his part is stopped.
He is of opinion that I saw clearer than he did about the weakness of
the municipal towns, the levies, peace, the city, the public funds,
occupying Pisenum. If however I do not go to him, when I can, he will
certainly be angry. From that I shrink--not for fear of harm he may do
me (for what can he do? And who

"Would be a slave but he who fears to die?"[83])

but because I shrink from being charged with ingratitude. So I trust
my arrival will be, as you say, welcome to him, whenever I go. As for
your remark "If Caesar's conduct be more temperate, you will weigh your
advice more carefully," how can Caesar keep himself from a destructive
policy? It is forbidden by his character, his previous career, the
nature of his present enterprise, his associates, the material strength
or even the moral firmness of the loyalist party.

not so much in a war as in a flight. For I can never put up with the
talk of your friends, whoever they are, for certainly they are not what
they are called, loyalists. Still that is just what I want to know,
what they do say, and I beg you earnestly to inquire and inform me. So
far I know nothing of what has happened at Brundisium. When I know, I
shall form my plans according to circumstances and the moment; but I
shall use your advice.

The son of Domitius went through Formiae on the 8th of March hastening
to his mother at Naples, and, when my slave Dionysius inquired
particularly from him about his father, he sent me a message that he
was outside the city. But I had heard that he had gone either to Pompey
or to Spain. What the fact is, I should much like to know, for it has
a bearing on the point I am now considering: if it is certain that
Domitius has found no means of departure, Pompey may understand that my
own departure from Italy is difficult, seeing that it is now beset with
troops and garrisons, and especially in the winter season. For, were it
a more convenient time of year, one could even cross the southern sea.
Now there is no choice but the Adriatic, to which passage is barred. So
please inquire both about Domitius and about Lentulus.

is the 9th of March. I expect Caesar reached Brundisium to-day or
yesterday. He stayed at Arpi on the 1st. If you choose to listen to
Postumus, Caesar meant to pursue Pompey; for, by calculating the state
of the weather and the days, he concluded that Pompey had crossed the
sea. I thought that Caesar would be unable to get crews, but Postumus
was quite sure about that, and the more so because ship-owners had
heard of Caesar's liberality. But it cannot be long now before I hear
the full story of what has happened at Brundisium.

Though now I rest only so long as I am writing to you or reading your
letters, still I am in want of subject matter, and feel sure that
you are in the same position, for the present crisis debars us from
the free and easy topics of friendly correspondence, and the topics
connected with the present crisis we have already exhausted. However,
not to succumb entirely to low spirits, I have taken for myself
certain theses, so to speak, which deal with _la haute politique_ and
are applicable to the present crisis, so that I may keep myself from
querulous thoughts and may practise the subject. Here are some:

Whether one should remain in one's country, even under a tyranny.
Whether any means are lawful to

abolish a tyranny, even if they endanger the existence of the State.
Whether one ought to take care that one who tries to abolish it may
not rise too high himself. Whether one ought to assist one's country,
when under a tyranny, by seizing opportunities and by argument rather
than by war. Whether one is doing one's duty to the State, if one
retires to some other place and there remains inactive, when there is
a tyranny; or whether one ought to run every risk for liberty. Whether
one ought to invade the country and besiege one's native town, when it
is under a tyranny. Whether one ought to enrol oneself in the ranks
of the loyalists, even if one does not approve of war as a means of
abolishing tyranny. Whether one ought in political matters to share the
dangers of one's benefactors and friends, even if one does not believe
their general policy to be wise. Whether one who has done good service
for his country, and by it has won ill-treatment and envy, should
voluntarily put himself into danger for that country, or may at length
take thought for himself and his dear ones and avoid struggles against
the powers that be.

By employing myself with such questions and discussing the pros and
cons in Greek and Latin, I divert my thoughts a little from my troubles
and at the same time consider a subject which is very pertinent. But
I fear you may find me a nuisance. For, if the bearer makes proper
headway, it will reach you on the very day you have your attack of
ague.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Formiae, March 10_, B.C. _49_]

On your birthday you wrote me a letter full of advice, full of
great kindness and of great wisdom. Philotimus delivered it to me
the day after he got it from you. The points you discuss are very
difficult--the route to the upper sea, a voyage by the lower sea,
departure to Arpinum, lest I should seem to have avoided Caesar,
remaining at Formiae, lest I should appear to have put myself forward
to congratulate him; but the most miserable thing of all will be to see
what I tell you must very shortly be seen.

Curtius Postumus was with me. I wrote you how tiresome he was. Quintus
Fufius also came to see me--what an air! what assurance!--hastening
to Brundisium denouncing Pompey's wrong-doings and the careless folly
of the House. When I cannot stand this under my own roof, how shall
I be able to endure Curtius in the Senate? But suppose I put up with
all this in good humour, what of the question "Your vote, M. Tullius?"
What will come of it? I pass over the cause of the Republic, which I
consider lost, both from the wounds dealt it and the cures prepared for
them; but what am I to do about Pompey? It is no use denying that I am
downright angry with him. For I am always more affected by the causes
of events than by the events themselves. Therefore considering our
incomparable woes, or rather concluding that they have happened by his
doing and his mistakes, I am more angry with Pompey than with Caesar
himself. Just as our ancestors

maiores nostri funestiorem diem esse voluerunt Aliensis pugnae
quam urbis captae, quod hoc malum ex illo (itaque alter religiosus
etiam nunc dies, alter in vulgus ignotus), sic ego decem annorum
peccata recordans, in quibus inerat ille etiam annus, qui nos hoc
non defendente, ne dicam gravius, adflixerat, praesentisque temporis
cognoscens temeritatem, ignaviam, neglegentiam suscensebam. Sed ea iam
mihi exciderunt; beneficia eiusdem cogito, cogito etiam dignitatem;
intellego serius equidem, quam vellem, propter epistulas sermonesque
Balbi, sed video plane nihil aliud agi, nihil actum ab initio, nisi ut
hunc occideret. Ego igitur, sicut ille apud Homerum, cui et mater et
dea dixisset:

           Αὐτίκα γάρ τοι ἔπειτα μεθ' Ἐκτορα πότμος ἕτοιμος,

matri ipse respondit:

    Αὐτίκα τεθναίην, ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἄρ' ἔμελλον ἑταίρῳ
    κτεινομένῳ ἐπαμῦναι.

Quid, si non ἑταίρῳ solum, sed etiam εὐεργέτῃ adde tali viro talem
causam agenti? Ego vero haec officia mercanda vita puto. Optimatibus
vero tuis nihil confido, nihil iam ne inservio quidem. Video, ut se
huic dent, ut daturi sint. Quicquam tu illa putas fuisse de valetudine
decreta municipiorum prae his de victoria gratulationibus? "Timent,"
inquies. At ipsi tum se timuisse dicunt. Sed videamus, quid actum sit
Brundisi. Ex eo fortasse alia consilia nascentur aliaeque litterae.

thought that the day of the battle of Alia was blacker than the day
of the capture of Rome, because the capture was but the consequence
of the battle (and so the former day is still a black letter day and
the latter is commonly unknown), so I too was angry in recalling his
errors of the last ten years, which included the year of my affliction,
when he gave me no help, to put it mildly, and recognizing his
foolhardiness, sloth and carelessness at the present time. But all this
I have forgotten. It is his kindness I think of, and I think of my own
honour too. I understand, later indeed than I could have wished, from
the letters and conversation of Balbus, but I see plainly, that the
sole object is, and has been from the beginning, the death of Pompey.
So I say the same as Achilles to his mother, when she said "For after
Hector's death thy doom is fixed," and he replied, "Then let me die,
since I have failed to save my friend."

[Sidenote: Iliad XVIII, 96-9]

And in my case it is not only a friend but a benefactor, a man so great
and championing so great a cause. Indeed I hold that life should be
paid for the kindnesses that he has done me. But in your loyal party I
have no confidence: nor I do even acknowledge any allegiance to them
now. I see how they surrender and will surrender themselves to Caesar.
Do you think that those decrees of the towns about Pompey's health were
anything compared with their congratulatory addresses to Caesar? You
will say, "They are terrorized." Yes, but they themselves declare that
they were terrorized on the former occasion. But let us see what has
happened at Brundisium. Perhaps from that may spring different plans
and a different letter.

CICERO ATTICO SAL.


[Sidenote: _Scr. Formiis V Id. Mart. a. 705_]

Nos adhuc Brundisio nihil. Roma scripsit Balbus putare iam Lentulum
consulem tramisisse, nec eum a minore Balbo conventum, quod is hoc
iam Canusi audisset; inde ad se eum scripsisse; cohortesque sex,
quae Albae fuissent, ad Curium via Minucia transisse; id Caesarem ad
se scripsisse, et brevi tempore eum ad urbem futurum. Ergo utar tuo
consilio neque me Arpinum hoc tempore abdam, etsi, Ciceroni meo togam
puram cum dare Arpini vellem, hanc eram ipsam excusationem relicturus
ad Caesarem. Sed fortasse in eo ipso offendetur, cur non Romae potius.
Ac tamen, si est conveniendus, hic potissimum. Tum reliqua videbimus,
id est et quo et qua et quando.

Domitius, ut audio, in Cosano est, et quidem, ut aiunt, paratus ad
navigandum, si in Hispaniam, non probo, si ad Gnaeum, laudo; quovis
potius certe, quam ut Curtium videat, quem ego patronus aspicere
non possum. Quid alios? Sed, opinor, quiescamus, ne nostram culpam
coarguamus, qui, dum urbem, id est patriam, amamus dumque rem
conventuram putamus, ita nos gessimus, ut plane interclusi captique
simus.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Formiae, March 11_, B.C. _49_]

No news yet from Brundisium. From Rome Balbus has written that he
thinks the consul Lentulus has now gone over, and that the younger
Balbus has not met him, because the latter has just heard the news at
Canusium and from that town has written to him. He adds that the six
cohorts which were at Alba have gone to Curius by the Minucian road,
that Caesar has written to tell him so and will shortly be in Rome. So
I shall follow your advice. I shall not go and bury myself in Arpinum
at the present time, though, since I had wished to celebrate my son's
coming of age there, I thought of leaving that as an excuse to Caesar.
But perhaps that itself will give offence and he might ask why I should
not do it at Rome. Still, if I must meet him, I would much rather meet
him here. Then I shall see the other things, where I am to go, by what
route and when.

Domitius, I hear, is at Cosa, and ready it is said to sail. If it is to
Spain, I do not approve, but, if to Pompey, he has my praise. Better
to go anywhere than to have to see Curtius, of whom, though I have
defended him, I cannot bear the sight, not to speak of others. But I
suppose I had better keep quiet, for fear of convicting myself of folly
in managing to be cut off wholly and made captive through my love of my
country and an idea that the matter could be patched up.

Just as I had finished writing, there came a letter from Capua, of
which this is a copy: "Pompey has crossed the sea with all the soldiery
he has. There

       *       *       *       *       *

fuerunt cum eo, omnes cum uxoribus et liberis. Conscendisse dicitur
a. d. IIII Nonas Martias. Ex ea die fuere septemtriones venti. Naves,
quibus usus non est, omnes aut praecidisse aut incendisse dicunt."

De hac re litterae L. Metello tribuno pl. Capuam allatae sunt a Clodia
socru, quae ipsa transiit. Ante sollicitus eram et angebar, sicut res
scilicet ipsa cogebat, cum consilio explicare nihil possem; nunc autem,
postquam Pompeius et consules ex Italia exierunt, non angor, sed ardeo
dolore,

Non sum, inquam, mihi crede, mentis compos; tantum mihi dedecoris
admisisse videor. Mene non primum cum Pompeio qualicumque consilio uso,
deinde cum bonis esse quamvis causa temere instituta? praesertim cum ii
ipsi, quoram ego causa timidius me fortunae committebam, uxor, filia,
Cicerones pueri, me illud sequi mallent, hoc turpe et me indignum
putarent. Nam Quintus quidem frater, quicquid mihi placeret, id rectum
se putare aiebat, id animo aequissimo sequebatur.

Tuas nunc epistulas a primo lego. Hae me paulum recreant. Primae monent
et rogant, ne me proiciam, proximae gaudere te ostendunt me remansisse.
Eas cum lego, minus mihi turpis videor, sed tam diu, dum lego. Deinde
emergit rursum dolor et ἀισχροῦ φαντασία. Quam ob rem obsecro te, mi
Tite, eripe

are 30,000 men, two consuls, tribunes and the senators who were with
him, all accompanied by wives and children. He is said to have embarked
on the 4th of March. From that day there have been northerly winds.
They say he disabled or burned all the ships he did not use."

[Sidennote Iliad x, 91]

On this matter a letter has been received at Capua by Lucius Metellus,
the tribune of the plebs, from Clodia, his mother-in-law, who herself
crossed the sea. I was anxious and distracted before, naturally enough
under the circumstances, when I could find no solution of affairs.
But, now that Pompey and the consuls have left Italy, I am not only
distracted, but I blaze with indignation. "Steady my heart no more,
but wild with grief." Believe me, I say I am no longer responsible,
so great the shame I seem to have incurred. To think that in the
first place I should not be with Pompey, whatever his plan, nor again
with the loyalists, however rashly they have mismanaged their cause!
Particularly when those very people, whose interests kept me cautious,
my wife, my daughter and the boys, preferred that I should follow
Pompey's fortunes, and thought Caesar's cause disgraceful and unworthy
of me. As for my brother Quintus, whatever I thought right, he agreed
to, and he followed my course with perfect contentment.

Your letters I am reading now from the beginning of the business. They
afford me some little relief. The first warn and entreat me not to
commit myself. The later ones show you are glad I stayed. While I read
them, my conduct seems to me less discreditable; but only so long as
I read: afterwards up rises sorrow again and a vision of shame. So I
beseech you, Titus,

       *       *       *       *       *

                                Page 198

mihi hunc dolorem, aut minue saltem aut consolatione aut consilio, aut
quacumque re potes. Quid tu autem possis? aut quid homo quisquam? Vix
iam deus.

Equidem illud molior, quod tu mones sperasque fieri posse, ut mihi
Caesar concedat, ut absim, cum aliquid in senatu contra Gnaeum agatur.
Sed timeo, ne non impetrem. Venit ab eo Furnius. Ut quidem scias, quos
sequamur, Q. Titini filium cum Caesare esse nuntiat, sed illum maiores
mihi gratias agere, quam vellem. Quid autem me roget paucis ille quidem
verbis, sed ἐν δυνάμει, cognosce ex ipsius epistula. Me miserum, quod
tu non valuisti! una fuissemus; consilium certe non defuisset; σύν τε
δύ' ἐρχομένω----.

Sed acta ne agamus, reliqua paremus. Me adhuc haec duo fefellerunt,
initio spes compositionis, qua facta volebam uti populari vita,
sollicitudine senectutem nostram liberari; deinde bellum crudele et
exitiosum suscipi a Pompeio intellegebam. Melioris medius fidius
civis et viri putabam quovis supplicio adfici, quam illi crudelitati
non solum praeesse, verum etiam interesse. Videtur vel mori satius
fuisse quam esse cum his. Ad haec igitur cogita, mi Attice, vel potius
excogita. Quemvis eventum fortius feram quam hunc dolorem.

take this grief away from me, or at any rate lessen it by your sympathy
or advice or by any other possible means. Yet what can you or any man
do? God Himself could hardly help now.

But my own aim now is to achieve what you advise and hope, that Caesar
excuse my absence, when any measure is brought forward against Pompey
in the house. But I fear I may fail. Furnius has come from Caesar. To
show you the sort of men I am following, he tells me that the son of Q.
Titinius is with Caesar, but Caesar expresses greater thanks to me than
I could wish. His request put in a few words, but _ex cathedra_, you
may see from his letter. How grieved I am at your ill-health! We should
have been together; assuredly advice would not have been wanting: "Two
heads are better than one."

[Sidenote: Iliad X, 224]

But let us not fight battles over again, let us attend to the future.
Till now two things have led me astray, at first the hope of a
settlement, and, if that were secured, I was ready for private life and
an old age quit of public cares; and then I discovered that Pompey was
beginning a bloody and destructive war. On my honour I thought that
it was the part of a better man and a better citizen to suffer any
punishment rather than, I will not say to take a leading part, but even
to take any part in such atrocities. It seems as though it would have
been preferable to die than to be one of such men. So, my dear Atticus,
think on these problems, or rather think them out. I shall bear any
result more bravely than this affliction.

CAESAR THE IMPERATOR SENDS GREETINGS TO CICERO THE IMPERATOR.

Though I have only had a glimpse of our friend Furnius, and have not
yet been able conveniently to speak to him or hear what he has to
say, being in a hurry and on the march, yet I could not neglect the
opportunity of writing to you and sending him to convey my thanks.
Be sure I have often thanked you and I expect to have occasion to do
so still more often in the future: so great are your services to me.
First I beg you, since I trust that I shall quickly reach Rome, to let
me see you there, and employ your advice, favour, position and help
of all kinds. I will return to what I began with: pardon my haste and
the shortness of my letter. All the other information you may get from

I wrote you a letter dated the 12th of March, but on that day the man
to whom I meant to give it did not set out. However, on that very
day there arrived that "sprinter," as Salvius called him, bringing
your very full epistle which has put just a drop of life into me, for
recovered I cannot profess to be. Clearly you have done the one thing
needful. Believe me I am not acting now with a view to a lucky issue;
for I see that we can never enjoy a Republic while these two men live,
or this one alone. So I

Ita neque de otio nostro spero iam nec ullam acerbitatem recuso. Unum
illud extimescebam, ne quid turpiter facerem, vel dicam iam ne fecissem.

Sic ergo habeto, salutares te mihi litteras misisse neque solum has
longiores, quibus nihil potest esse explicatius, nihil perfectius, sed
etiam illas breviores, in quibus hoc mihi iucundissimum fuit, consilium
factumque nostrum a Sexto probari, pergratumque mihi tu ...[84]
fecisti; a quo et diligi me et, quid rectum sit, intellegi scio.
Longior vero tua epistula non me solum, sed meos omnes aegritudine
levavit. Itaque utar tuo consilio et ero in Formiano, ne aut ad urbem
ἀπάντησις mea animadvertatur, aut, si nec hic nec illic eum videro,
devitatum se a me putet. Quod autem suades, ut ab eo petam, ut mihi
concedat, ut idem tribuam Pompeio, quod ipsi tribuerim, id me iam
pridem agere intelleges ex litteris Balbi et Oppi, quarum exempla tibi
misi. Misi etiam Caesaris ad eos sana mente scriptas quo modo in tanta
insania. Sin mihi Caesar hoc non concedat, video tibi placere illud, me

have no hope of ease for myself and I do not refuse to contemplate as
possible any bitterness. The one thing I dread is doing, or, perhaps I
should say, having done, anything disgraceful.

[Sidenote: Odyssey xi, 663]

So please consider that your letter was good for me, and not only the
longer, most explicit and perfect epistle, but also the shorter, in
which the most delightful thing was to find that my policy and action
is approved by Sextus. You have done me a great kindness....[85] Of
his affection and sense of honour I am sure. But that longer letter of
yours has relieved not only me but all my friends from our sorry state:
so I will follow your advice and remain in the villa at Formiae, that
my meeting with Caesar outside the city may not excite comment, or, if
I do not meet him either here or there, I may not lead him to think
I have shunned him. As for your advice to ask him to allow me to pay
Pompey the same homage as I did to him, you will understand I have been
doing that long since, when you see the copies I forward of letters
of Balbus and Oppius. I send also a letter addressed by Caesar to
them, which is sane enough considering these mad times. But, if Caesar
should refuse my request, I see that you think I should undertake to
be a peace-maker. In that rôle I do not fear danger--for, with so many
dangers overhanging, why should I not compound by taking the most
respectable--but I fear lest I may embarrass Pompey, and he fix on me
"the Gorgon gaze of his dread eye." It is wonderful to see how Pompey
desires to imitate Sulla's reign. I know what I am saying. He has made
no secret of it. Then why

enough of this.] "Then the cause is not good?" Yes, the best in the
world; but remember it will be handled in the most disgraceful way. The
first plan is to throttle Rome and Italy and starve them, then to lay
waste and burn the country, and not to keep hands off the riches of
the wealthy. But, since I have the same fears on Caesar's side too, if
it were not for favours on the other side, I should think it better to
stay in Rome and suffer what comes. But so bounden do I consider myself
to Pompey that I cannot endure to risk the charge of ingratitude. But
you have said all that can be said for that course too.

About my triumph I agree with you. I can throw it away willingly and
with ease. I am delighted with your remark that it may be, while I am
considering, "the chance to sail" may arise. "Yes," you say, "if only
Pompey is firm enough." He is more firm than I imagined. In him you
may be confident. I promise you, if he succeeds, he will not leave a
tile in Italy. "Will you help him, then?" By heaven, against my own
judgement and against all the lessons of the past I desire to depart,
not so much that I may help Pompey, as that I may not see what is being
done here. For please do not think that the madness of these parties
will be endurable or of one kind. However, it is obvious to you that
when laws, juries, courts and Senate are abolished, neither private nor
public resources will be able to bear up against the lusts, daring,
extravagance and necessity of so many needy men. So let me depart on
any kind of voyage: be it whatever you will, only let me depart.

If, as you say, my conduct hitherto has been approved by the loyal

The last thing I have to say is, that perhaps you lack a theme for your

reaches Rome, that is to say try to effect a reconciliation with
Pompey, we should feel it our duty to exhort you to take part in
the negotiations, as the whole thing could most easily and with the
greatest dignity be carried through by you, who have ties with both
parties. If on the contrary we thought Caesar was not going to follow
that course, and knew that he even wished to wage war with Pompey,
we should never advise you to bear arms against a man who has done
you such good service, just as we have always begged you not to
fight against Caesar. But, since Caesar's intentions are still mere
guesswork, we can only say that it does not seem consonant with your
dignity or your well-known sense of honour to bear arms against either
of them, as you are intimate with both: and we have no doubt that
Caesar will be generous enough to approve of this course. If you wish
it, however, we will write to Caesar to ascertain his intentions in
this matter. If he sends us an answer, we will let you know our opinion
at once, and convince you that we are giving the advice which seems
to us to be best for your dignity, not for Caesar's policy, and, such
is Caesar's consideration for his friends, that we feel sure he will
approve of such a course.

et Pompei reconciliare, et quam remotus sit ab omni crudelitate; quod
eum sentire, ut debeo, valde gaudeo. De te et tua fide et pietate

eius adversariis fueris. Atque hoc non solum in te, tali et tanto viro,
satis habebit, sed etiam mihi ipse sua concessit voluntate, ne in iis
castris essem, quae contra Lentulum aut Pompeium futura essent, quorum
beneficia maxima haberem, sibique satis esse dixit, si togatus urbana

see how eager he is for a reconciliation between himself and Pompey,
and how far removed all cruelty is from his thoughts: and I am, as in
duty bound, very glad that he takes that view. As for yourself and
your honour, and loyalty to your friends, I give you my word, my dear
Cicero, that I think as you do, that your reputation and your duty will
not admit of your bearing arms against a man, from whom you acknowledge
that you have received such favours. I have not the slightest doubt
that Caesar with his extraordinary kindness will agree, and that you
will satisfy him abundantly, by taking no part against him in the war
and not siding with his opponents. And this he will count sufficient
not only in the case of so important a personage as yourself, but even
to me of his own free will he has granted the same permission not to
enter a camp which would be opposed to Lentulus and Pompey, to whom I
am under great obligations: and he has said he is quite satisfied, if I
should perform peaceful civic functions for him, which I am at liberty
to perform for them too, if I wish. So I am acting now as Lentulus'
deputy at Rome and carrying out his business, fulfilling my duty and
maintaining my honour and loyalty to them. But really, though I had
given up hope of peace, I am no longer in despair of it, since Caesar
is in the mood in which we would wish him to be.

Under the circumstances I see no objection, if you think fit, to
your writing and asking for his protection, as you did for Pompey's,
with my approval, at Milo's trial. If I know anything of Caesar, I
will guarantee that he will consider your dignity more than his own
advantage.

I am very glad to hear from your letters how strongly you approve
of what happened at Corfinium. I shall follow your advice with
pleasure--with all the more pleasure, because I had myself made up my
mind to act with the greatest moderation, and to do my best to effect
a reconciliation with Pompey. Let us see if by moderation we can win
all hearts and secure a lasting victory, since by cruelty others have
been unable to escape from hatred and to maintain their victory for
any length of time except L. Sulla, whose example I do not intend to
follow. This is a new way of conquering, to strengthen one's position
by kindness and generosity. As to how this can be done, some ideas have
occurred to me and many more can be found. I should like you to turn
some attention to the matter.

I have taken N. Magius, a praefect of Pompey. Of course I kept to my
policy and set him free at once.

As I was dining on the 14th, and indeed after nightfall, Statius
brought a short letter from you. For your query about L. Torquatus, not
only Lucius but also Aulus has gone [the former some two days],[91] the
latter a long time ago. For your news about the sale of prisoners at
Reate, I am sorry that the seeds of a proscription should be sown in
the Sabine district. That many members of the House are at Rome, I also
have heard. Can you give any reason why they ever left it? Here there
is an idea based on guesswork rather than message or dispatch that
Caesar will be at Formiae on March the 22nd. I wish I could have here
Homer's Minerva disguised as Mentor, that I might say to her, "Mentor,
how shall I go, and how shall I welcome him, pray?" I have never had a
more difficult step to think of. But I think of it nevertheless: nor
shall I be unprepared, so far as the evil days permit. Take care of

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Formiae, March 17_, B.C. _49_]

I got three letters from you on the 16th. They were dated the 12th,
13th and 14th. So I will take the earliest first. I agree with you that
it is best for me to stay at Formiae. I also agree about the Adriatic.
But as I wrote you before, I will strive to discover how I may be able
with Caesar's goodwill to keep quite clear of politics. You praise me
for saying that I forget Pompey's former misdeeds and ill-doings, but
it is a fact. Nay, those very actions you call to mind, in which he did
harm to me myself, have no place in my memory. I am so determined to
feel gratitude for his kindness rather than resentment for injuries.
Let me act then as you decree, and pull myself together. For I
philosophize as I walk about my estate, and in my perambulations I do
not cease to ponder my themes. But some of them are very difficult to
decide. As for the loyalists, let it be as you wish. You know the old
saying "Dionysius in Corinth."[93]

[93] Dionysius, when expelled from the throne of Syracuse, fled to
Corinth and according to some authorities set up a school there. But
whether the saying here mentioned refers merely to his exile and means
"There are ups and downs in life," or to his schoolmastering, as Jeans
suggests, referring to a passage in _Tusc._ III, 27, where Cicero
says Dionysius took to schoolmastering because he wished to tyrannize
over somebody, is uncertain. If the latter, it would mean that the
_optimates_ would ill-use Cicero again as soon as they got the power.

Titinius' son is with Caesar. You seem to fear that your advice irks
me; but nothing indeed pleases me except your counsel and your letters.
So do as you promise. Do not omit to write to me anything that comes
into your mind; for nothing can delight me more.

I turn now to your next letter. You are right not

       *       *       *       *       *

Clodia. Falsum etiam de corruptis navibus. Quod consules laudas, ego
quoque animum laudo, sed consilium reprehendo; dispersu enim illorum
actio de pace sublata est, quam quidem ego meditabar. Itaque postea
Demetri librum de concordia tibi remisi et Philotimo dedi. Nec vero
dubito, quin exitiosum bellum impendeat; cuius initium ducetur a
fame. Et me tamen doleo non interesse huic bello! In quo tanta vis
sceleris futura est, ut, cum parentes non alere nefarium sit, nostri
principes antiquissimam et sanctissimam parentem, patriam, fame
necandam putent. Atque hoc non opinione timeo, sed interfui sermonibus.
Omnis haec classis Alexandria, Colchis, Tyro, Sidone, Arado, Cypro,
Pamphylia, Lycia, Rhodo, Chio, Byzantio, Lesbo, Zmyrna, Mileto, Coo
ad intercludendos commeatus Italiae et ad occupandas frumentarias
provincias comparatur. At quam veniet iratus! et iis quidem maxime,
qui eum maxime salvum volebant, quasi relictus ab iis, quos reliquit.
Itaque mihi dubitanti, quid me facere par sit, permagnum pondus adfert
benevolentia erga illum; qua dempta perire melius esset in patria quam
patriam servando evertere. De septemtrione plane ita est. Metuo,

to believe the reports about the number of Pompey's soldiers.
Clodia's letter made them just double. It was untrue also about the
destruction of the vessels. You praise the consuls; so do I praise
their courage, but I blame their policy. Their departure has destroyed
the negotiations for peace, the very thing which I was contemplating.
So after that I returned you Demetrius' book on Concord and gave it to
Philotimus. And I have no doubt a disastrous war is imminent, which
will be ushered in by famine. And here I am lamenting that I have no
hand in the war, a war which will be so criminal, that though it is
wicked not to support one's parents, yet our chiefs will not hesitate
to destroy by starvation their country, that most reverend and holiest
of parents! And my fears are not based on mere surmise. I have heard
their talk. All this fleet from Alexandria, Colchis, Tyre, Sidon,
Aradus, Cyprus, Pamphylia, Lycia, Rhodes, Chius, Byzantium, Lesbos,
Smyrna, Miletus, Cos, is being got ready to cut off the supplies of
Italy and to blockade the grain-producing provinces. And how angry
Pompey will be when he comes, particularly with those who particularly
desire his safety, as if he were abandoned by those whom he has
abandoned! So in my doubt what I ought to do, I am greatly swayed by my
good feeling towards Pompey. Without that it were better to perish in
my country, than to destroy my country by saving it. As to the north
wind, it is clearly as you write. I fear Epirus

ne vexetur Epirus; sed quem tu locum Graeciae non direptum iri
putas? Praedicat enim palam et militibus ostendit se largitione ipsa
superiorem quam hunc fore. Illud me praeclare admones, cum illum
videro, ne nimis indulgenter, et ut cum gravitate potius loquar. Plane
sic faciendum. Arpinum, cum eum convenero, cogito, ne forte aut absim,
cum veniet, aut cursem huc illuc via deterrima. Bibulum, ut scribis,
audio venisse et redisse pridie Idus.

Philotimum, ut ais in epistula tertia, exspectabas. At ille Idibus a
me profectus est. Eo serius ad tuam illam epistulam, cui ego statim

ita opinor esse, ut et in Cosano sit, et consilium eius ignoretur.
Iste omnium turpissimus et sordidissimus, qui consularia comitia a
praetore ait haberi posse, est idem, qui semper in re publica fuit.
Itaque nimirum hoc illud est, quod Caesar scribit in ea epistula,
cuius exemplum ad te misi, se velle uti "consilio" meo (age, esto;
hoc commune est), "gratia" (ineptum id quidem, sed, puto, hoc simulat
ad quasdam senatorum sententias), "dignitate" (fortasse sententiae
consularis). Illud extremum est: "ope omnium rerum." Id ego suspicari
coepi tum ex tuis litteris aut hoc ipsum esse aut non multo secus. Nam
permagni eius interest rem ad interregnum non venire. Id adsequitur, si
per praetorem consules creantur. Nos autem in libris

may be harassed, but do you suppose there is any part of Greece that
will not be robbed? Pompey openly declares and shows his men that he
will be more liberal even than Caesar in largesse. You do well to
advise me, when I see Caesar, not to be too complacent, and to speak
rather with dignity. Clearly I must do so. I am thinking of going to
Arpinum after I have met him; for I do not want to be absent on his
arrival, or to have to travel to and fro in the wretched condition of
the roads. I hear, as you write, that Bibulus came and went back on the
14th.

[Sidenote: Iliad iv, 182]

You say in your third letter that you were awaiting Philotimus. He set
out from me on the 15th. That was why my reply to your letter, which
I wrote immediately, was late in reaching you. I think you are right
about Domitius, that he is in his place at Cosa; but what his plan
is, is not known. That disgraceful mean blackguard M. Lepidus, who
says that the consular elections may be held by a praetor, is playing
his old part in politics. So that was the meaning of the passage in
Caesar's letter of which I sent you a copy, that he wanted to enjoy my
"advice" (well, that is a general expression), my "influence" (that
is flattery, but I suppose he affects to want it with a view to the
votes of certain senators), my "position" (perhaps he means my vote as
an ex-consul). His last phrase is "help in every way." I have begun
to suspect from your letter that that is the point, or something very
like it. For it is highly important to him that there should not be
an interregnum. That point is attained, if consuls are created by a
praetor. But in our state books it is set down that it is illegal not
only for

habemus non modo consules a praetore, sed ne praetores quidem creari
ius esse, idque factum esse numquam; consules eo non esse ius, quod
maius imperium a minore rogari non sit ius, praetores autem, quod ita
rogentur, ut collegae consulibus sint, quorum est maius imperium.

quamquam est bellum, minoris aestimo, quam aestimabatur Marcellino
consule, cum ego istos hortulos propter domum Anti, quam tum habebam,
iucundiores mihi fore putabam et minore impensa, quam si Tusculanum
refecissem. Volui HS. Q. Egi per praedem, ille daret tanti, cum haberet

consuls to be created by the praetors, but for the very praetors
themselves, and that it has never been done; that it is illegal for
consuls, because it is illegal for persons with greater powers to be
proposed for election by those with less; for praetors, because they
are proposed as colleagues of the consuls who have the greater powers.
The next thing will be, he will want me to vote for it, and he will
not be content with Galba, Scaevola, Cassius and Antonius, "then let
the wide earth swallow me." But you see what a storm is coming. Which
senators have crossed over to Pompey I will tell you as soon as I
know. You are right about the corn supply: it cannot be done without
taxation: and you have cause to fear the exorbitant demands of Pompey's
associates and a wicked war. I should much like to see my friend
Trebatius, although you tell me he is in despair. Do bid him hurry,
for it will be convenient, if he comes before Caesar's arrival. As for
that estate at Lanuvium, as soon as I heard of the death of Phamea, I
longed, if the constitution was going to last, that one of my friends
should buy it, and yet I did not think of you, my best friend of all.
For I know that it is your custom to inquire in how many years you
may recoup yourself of a purchase, and the value of fixtures, and I
had seen your inventory not only at Rome but at Delos. But, though it
is a pretty property, I rate it at a lower value than it was rated in
Marcellinus' consulship, when I thought that, owing to the house I then
had at Antium, those little gardens would please me better and cost
less than the repair of my villa at Tusculum. I wanted the property for
£4,500.[95] I made an offer to that amount through a third party, when
he was putting

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Formiae, March 18_, B.C. _49_]

I have nothing to write. There is no news that I have heard, and all
your letters I answered yesterday. But as a sick heart not only robs
me of sleep, but will not allow me even to keep awake without the
greatest pain, I have begun to write to you something or other without
any definite subject, that I may have a sort of talk with you, the only
thing that gives me relief.

I seem to myself to have been mad from the very beginning, and the one
thing that tortures me is that I did not follow Pompey like a private
soldier, when he was slipping or rather rushing to ruin. I saw he was
terrified on the 17th of January: on that day I felt what he would do.
Since then I have never approved his course, and he has never ceased to
commit one blunder after another. Meantime not a letter to me, nothing
but thoughts of flight. Well! Just as in love affairs men are repelled
by untidiness, stupidity and indelicacy, so the ugliness of

avertit ab amore. Nihil enim dignum faciebat, quare eius fugae comitem
me adiungerem. Nunc emergit amor, nunc desiderium ferre non possum,
nunc mihi nihil libri, nihil litterae, nihil doctrina prodest. Ita
dies et noctes tamquam avis illa mare prospecto, evolare cupio. Do, do
poenas temeritatis meae. Etsi quae fuit illa temeritas? quid feci non
consideratissime? Si enim nihil praeter fugam quaereretur, fugissem
libentissime, sed genus belli crudelissimi et maximi, quod nondum
vident homines quale futurum sit, perhorrui. Quae minae municipiis,
quae nominatim viris bonis, quae denique omnibus, qui remansissent!
quam crebro illud "Sulla potuit, ego non potero?"! Mihi autem haeserunt
illa. Male Tarquinius, qui Porsenam, qui Octavium Mamilium contra
patriam, impie Coriolanus, qui auxilium petiit a Volscis, recte
Themistocles, qui mori maluit, nefarius Hippias, Pisistrati filius,
qui in Marathonia pugna cecidit arma contra patriam ferens. At Sulla,
at Marius, at Cinna recte, immo iure fortasse; sed quid eorum victoria
crudelius, quid funestius? Huius belli genus fugi, et eo magis, quod
crudeliora etiam cogitari et parari videbam. Me, quem non nulli
conservatorem istius urbis, quem parentem esse dixerunt, Getarum et
Armeniorum et Colchorum copias ad eam adducere? me meis civibus famem,
vastitatem inferre Italiae? Hunc primum mortalem esse, deinde etiam

his flight and his carelessness have estranged my love. For he has
done nothing of a kind to induce me to share his flight. But now my
old love breaks forth: now I miss him intolerably: now books, letters,
philosophy, do not help me one whit. Day and night, like that bird,[96]
I gaze at the sea, and long to take flight. Sorely am I punished for my
rashness. Yet what rashness was there? I acted with all deliberation.
For, if flight were his only object, I would have fled gladly enough.
But I was aghast at warfare so cruel and desperate, the upshot of which
is still unknown. What threats against the country towns, against
the loyalists by name, in fact against all who should stay behind!
How frequently has he remarked "Sulla could do it, and shall not I?"
I could not get rid of thoughts like these. It was base in Tarquin
to egg on Porsena and Octavius Mamilius against his country; it was
wicked in Coriolanus, to seek help from the Volscians. Themistocles
was right who preferred to die. What a dastard was Hippias, the son of
Pisistratus, who fell at the battle of Marathon, bearing arms against
his country! Yes, but Sulla and Marius and Cinna acted rightly, perhaps
one should say within their rights; but then victory brought cruelty
and death. I shrank from a war of that kind, and also because I saw
cruelty even greater was being planned and prepared. Was it for me,
whom some called the saviour and father of Rome, to bring against her
hordes of Getae, Armenians and Colchians? Was it for me to bring famine
on my fellow-townsmen and devastation on Italy? In the first place I
reflected that Caesar was

multis modis posse exstingui cogitabam, urbem autem et populum nostrum
servandum ad immortalitatem, quantum in nobis esset, putabam, et tamen
spes quaedam me oblectabat fore ut aliquid conveniret, potius quam aut
hic tantum sceleris aut ille tantum flagitii admitteret.

Alia res nunc tota est, alia mens mea. Sol, ut est in tua quadam
epistula, excidisse mihi e mundo videtur. Ut aegroto, dum anima est,
spes esse dicitur, sic ego, quoad Pompeius in Italia fuit, sperare non
destiti. Haec, haec me fefellerunt, et, ut verum loquar, aetas iam a
diuturnis laboribus devexa ad otium domesticarum me rerum delectatione
mollivit. Nunc, si vel periculose experiundum erit, experiar certe,
ut hinc avolem. Ante oportuit fortasse; sed ea, quae scripsisti, me
tardarunt, et auctoritas maxime tua. Nam, cum ad hunc locum venissem,
evolvi volumen epistularum tuarum, quod ego sub signo habeo servoque
diligentissime. Erat igitur in ea, quam X K. Febr. dederas, hoc modo:
"Sed videamus, et Gnaeus quid agat, et illius rationes quorsum fluant.
Quodsi iste Italiam relinquet, faciet omnino male, et, ut ego existimo,
ἀλογίστως, sed tum demum consilia nostra commutanda erunt." Hoc scribis
post diem quartum, quam ab urbe discessimus. Deinde VIII K. Febr.:
"Tantum modo Gnaeus noster ne, ut urbem ἀλογίστως reliquit, sic Italiam
relinquat." Eodem die das alteras litteras, quibus mihi consulenti
planissime respondes. Est enim sic: "Sed venio ad consultationem tuam.
Si Gnaeus Italia cedit, in urbem redeundum puto; quae enim finis
peregrinationis?" Hoc mihi

mortal, and besides might be got rid of in many ways. But I thought
that our city and our people should be preserved so far as in us lay
for immortality; and anyhow I cherished a hope that some arrangement
might be made before Caesar perpetrated such a crime or Pompey such
iniquity.

Now the case is altered and my mind is altered too. The sun, as you
say in one of your letters, seems to me to have fallen out of the
universe. As a sick man is said to have hope, so long as he has breath,
so I did not cease to hope so long as Pompey was in Italy. This, this
was what deceived me, and to speak the truth after my long labours my
life's evening falling peacefully has made me lazy with the thought of
domestic pleasures. But now, even if risk must be run in fleeing hence,
assuredly I will run it. Perhaps I ought to have done it before: but
the points you wrote about delayed me, and especially your influence.
For, when I got so far, I opened the packet of your letters, which
I keep under seal and preserve with the greatest care. In a letter
dated the 21st of January, you make the following remark: "Let us see
Pompey's policy and the drift of his plans. Now if he leave Italy, it
will be wrong and to my mind irrational: but then and not till then
will be the time to change our plans." This you wrote on the fourth day
after I left Rome. Then on the 23rd of January: "I only pray that our
friend Pompey will not leave Italy, as he has irrationally left Rome."
On the same day you wrote another letter, a frank reply to my request
for advice. It runs: "But to answer the question on which you ask
advice, if Pompey leaves Italy, I think you ought to return to Rome:
for what can be the end to his

plane haesit, et nunc ita video, infinitum bellum iunctum miserrima
fuga, quam tu peregrinationem ὑποκορίζη. Sequitur χρησμὸς VI K.
Februarias: "Ego, si Pompeius manet in Italia, nec res ad pactionem
venit, longius bellum puto fore; sin Italiam relinquit, ad posterum
bellum ἄσπονδον strui existimo." Huius igitur belli ego particeps et
socius et adiutor esse cogor, quod et ἄσπονδον est et cum civibus?
Deinde VII Idus Febr., cum iam plura audires de Pompei consilio,
concludis epistulam quandam hoc modo: "Ego quidem tibi non sim
auctor, si Pompeius Italiam relinquit, te quoque profugere. Summo
enim periculo facies nec rei publicae proderis; cui quidem posterius
poteris prodesse, si manseris." Quem φιλόπατριν ac πολιτικὸν hominis
prudentis et amici tali admonitu non moveret auctoritas? Deinceps III
Idus Febr. iterum mihi respondes consulenti sic: "Quod quaeris a me,
fugamne[97] defendam an moram utiliorem putem, ego vero in praesentia
subitum discessum et praecipitem profectionem cum tibi tum ipsi Gnaeo
inutilem et periculosam puto, et satius esse existimo vos dispertitos
et in speculis esse; sed medius fidius turpe nobis puto esse de
fuga cogitare." Hoc turpe Gnaeus noster biennio ante cogitavit. Ita
sullaturit animus eius et proscripturit iam diu. Inde, ut opinor, cum
tu ad me quaedam γενικώτερον scripsisses, et ego mihi a te significari
putassem, ut Italia cederem, detestaris hoc diligenter XI K. Mart.:
"Ego vero nulla epistula significavi, si Gnaeus Italia cederet, ut tu
una cederes, aut, si significavi, non dico fui inconstans,

[97] fugamne--putem, as _Otto Müller: M reads_ fugamne fidam (_corr.
from_ fedam) an moram defendam utiliorem putem. _Other suggested
emendations are_ fugamne suadeam an moram defendam utilioremque
putem _(Klotz), and_ fugamne foedam an moram desidem utiliorem putem
(_Manutius_).

wanderings?" This gave me pause, and I see now endless war is attached
to that wretched flight, which you playfully called "wandering." There
follows your prophecy of the 25th of January: "If Pompey stays in Italy
and no arrangement is reached, I fancy there will be a very long war.
If he leaves Italy, I think that for the future there will be war _à
l'outrance_." In this war then _à l'outrance_, this civil war, am I
forced to take part and lot and share? Next on the 7th of February,
when you had heard more of Pompey's plans, you end a letter as follows:
"I would not advise you to flee, if Pompey leaves Italy. You will run
a very great risk, and will not help the country, which you may be
able to help hereafter, if you remain." What patriot and politician
would not be influenced by such advice from a wise man and a friend?
Next on the 11th of February you answer my request for counsel again
as follows: "You ask me whether I hold that flight or delay is more
useful. Well, I think that at the present juncture a sudden departure
and hasty journey would be useless and dangerous both to yourself and
to Pompey, and that it were better for you to be apart, and each on
his own watch tower. But upon my honour I hold it disgraceful of us to
think of flight." This disgrace our Pompey meditated two years ago: so
long has he been eager to play at Sulla and proscriptions. Then, as
I fancy, when you had written to me in more general terms and I had
thought that some of your remarks hinted at my departure from Italy,
you protest emphatically against it on the 19th of February: "In no
letter have I hinted that you should accompany Pompey, if he leaves
Italy, or, if I did hint it, I was worse than inconsistent, I was mad."


       *       *       *       *       *

sed demens." In eadem epistula alio loco: "Nihil relinquitur nisi
fuga; cui te socium neutiquam puto esse oportere nec umquam putavi."
Totam autem hanc deliberationem evolvis accuratius in litteris VIII
Kal. Mart. datis: "Si M'. Lepidus et L. Volcacius remanent, manendum
puto, ita ut, si salvus sit Pompeius et constiterit alicubi, hanc
νέκυιαν relinquas et te in certamine vinci cum illo facilius patiaris
quam cum hoc in ea, quae perspicitur futura, colluvie regnare." Multa
disputas huic sententiae convenientia. Inde ad extremum: "Quid, si,
inquis", "Lepidus et Volcacius discedunt? Plane ἀπορῶ. Quod evenerit
igitur, et quod egeris, id στερκτέον putabo." Si tum dubitaras, nunc
certe non dubitas istis manentibus. Deinde in ipsa fuga V Kal. Martias:
"Interea non dubito quin in Formiano mansurus sis. Commodissime enim
τὸ μέλλον ibi καραδοκήσεις." Ad K. Mart., cum ille quintum iam diem
Brundisi esset: "Tum poterimus deliberare non scilicet integra re, sed
certe minus infracta, quam si una proieceris te." Deinde IIII Non.
Martias, ὑπὸ τὴν λῆψιν cum breviter scriberes, tamen ponis hoc: "Cras
scribam plura et ad omnia; hoc tamen dicam, non paenitere me consilii
de tua mansione, et, quamquam magna sollicitudine, tamen, quia minus
mali puto esse quam in illa profectione, maneo in sententia et gaudeo
te mansisse." Cum vero iam angerer et timerem, ne quid a me dedecoris
esset admissum, III Nonas Mart.: "Tamen te non esse una cum Pompeio non
fero moleste. Postea, si opus fuerit, non erit difficile, et

       *       *       *       *       *

                                Page 233

In the same letter there is another passage: "Nothing is left for
Pompey but flight, in which I do not think and never have thought that
you should share." This counsel you unroll in detail in your letter
dated the 22nd of February: "If M'. Lepidus and L. Volcacius stay, I
think you should stay, provided, if Pompey wins safety and makes a
stand anywhere, you should leave these _âmes damnées_, and rather share
defeat with him than share Caesar's sovereignty in the mire that will
be." You argue at length in support of this view, then at the end you
say: "What if Lepidus and Volcacius depart? I am quite at a loss. So I
shall think you must face the event and abide by what you have done."
If you had any doubt then, you certainly have no doubt left now, as
those two persons remain in Italy. Next, when the flight was actually
made on Feb. 25: "Meantime I have no doubt you should stay at Formiae.
It will be most convenient there to await the event." On the 1st of
March, when Pompey had been four days at Brundisium: "Then we shall
be able to debate, not indeed with a free hand but assuredly less
hampered, than if you had shared his plunge." Next on the 4th of March,
though you scribbled a line on the eve of your fever bout, nevertheless
you say this: "I will write more to-morrow, and answer all your
questions. But I maintain this, that I am not sorry for advising you
to stay, and, though very anxious, still, because I fancy it is better
than flight, I stick to my opinion and am glad that you have stayed
in Italy." When I was already tortured with fear that my conduct was
disgraceful on the 5th of March you write: "However I am not sorry that
you are not with Pompey. Hereafter, if need arise, it will be easy,

       *       *       *       *       *

Lentulum nostrum scis Puteolis esse? Quod cum e viatore quodam
esset auditum, qui se diceret eum in Appia, cum is paulum lecticam
aperuisset, cognosse, etsi vix veri simile, misi tamen Puteolos pueros,
qui pervestigarent, et ad eum litteras. Inventus est vix in hortis suis
se occultans litterasque mihi remisit mirifice gratias agens Caesari;
de suo autem consilio C. Caesio mandata ad me dedisse. Eum ego hodie
exspectabam, id est XIII K. Apriles.

and to him, whenever it happens, acceptable. When I say this, it is
with the reservation, that, if Caesar continues, as he has begun,
acting with good faith, moderation and prudence, I must thoroughly
review the matter and consider more closely what our interests advise."
On the 9th of March you write that my friend Peducaeus too approves my
inaction: and his authority has much weight with me. From these lines
of yours I console myself with the reflection that so far I have done
nothing wrong: but pray support your position. So far as I am concerned
there is no need: but I want others to be my accomplices. If I have not
done wrong so far, I will take care of the future. Do you maintain your
exhortations and assist me with your reflections. Here nothing as yet
has been heard about Caesar's return. For myself I have won thus much
good by my letter, I have read all yours and found rest in the act.

Do you know that our friend Lentulus is at Puteoli? I heard this from
a passer-by, who declared he recognized him on the Appian road as he
drew aside the curtains of his litter, and, though it seemed hardly
probable, I sent servants to Puteoli to track him and hand him a
letter. He was found with difficulty concealing himself on his estate,
and returned me a letter in which he expressed amazing gratitude to
Caesar. But about his own plans he said he had sent me a message by C.
Caesius. I expect him to-day, the 20th of March.

Matius also came to me on the 19th of March.

mehercule, ut mihi visus est, temperatus et prudens; existimatus
quidem est semper auctor otii. Quam ille hoc non probare mihi quidem
visus est, quam illam νέκυιαν, ut tu appellas, timere! Huic ego in
multo sermone epistulam ad me Caesaris ostendi, eam cuius exemplum ad
te antea misi, rogavique, ut interpretaretur, quid esset, quod ille
scriberet, "consilio meo se uti velle, gratia, dignitate, ope rerum
omnium." Respondit se non dubitare, quin et opem et gratiam meam ille
ad pacificationem quaereret. Utinam aliquod in hac miseria rei publicae
πολιτικὸν opus efficere et navare mihi liceat! Matius quidem et illum
in ea sententia esse confidebat et se auctorem fore pollicebatur.

Pridie autem apud me Crassipes fuerat, qui se pridie Non. Martias
Brundisio profectum atque ibi Pompeium reliquisse dicebat, quod etiam,
qui viii Idus illinc profecti erant, nuntiabant; illa vero omnes,
in quibus etiam Crassipes, qui pro sua prudentia potuit attendere,
sermones minaces, inimicos optimatium, municipiorum hostes, meras
proscriptiones, meros Sullas; quae Lucceium loqui, quae totam Graeciam,
quae vero Theophanem! Et tamen omnis spes salutis in illis est, et ego
excubo animo nec partem ullam capio quietis et, ut has pestes effugiam,
cum dissimillimis nostri esse cupio! Quid enim tu illic Scipionem, quid
Faustum, quid Libonem praetermissurum sceleris putas, quorum creditores
convenire dicuntur? quid eos autem, cum vicerint, in cives effecturos?
quam vero μικροψυχίαν Gnaei nostri esse? Nuntiant Aegyptum et Arabiam

He seemed to me, I do declare, moderate and sensible: certainly he
has always been thought to be in favour of peace. How he disliked
this present pass! How he seemed to fear these _âmes damnées_, as you
call them! In the course of a long talk I showed him Caesar's letter
to me, of which I sent you a copy before, and I asked him to explain
what Caesar meant by writing that he wished "to take advantage of my
advice, my influence, my position and my help of all sorts." Matius
replied that undoubtedly Caesar wanted my help and influence to make
peace. Would that I could succeed in carrying through some political
compromise in this miserable state of affairs! Matius himself declared
that Caesar had that feeling, and promised that he would help such a
course.

However the day before Crassipes had been with me, and he said that
he had quitted Brundisium on the 6th of March and left Pompey there;
the same tale was brought by those who quitted the place on the 8th.
All of them, and among the rest Crassipes, who was quite capable of
observing what was going on, had the same story, threatening words,
breach with the loyalists, hostility to the municipalities, nothing but
proscriptions, nothing but Sullas. How Lucceius talked, all the Greeks
and Theophanes too! Nevertheless the only hope of safety lies in them,
and I am on the watch and take no rest and long to be with the most
uncongenial associates to escape the plague here. For what crime do
you think that Scipio will stick at, or Faustus and Libo, when their
creditors are said to be selling them up, and what do you suppose they
will do to the citizens when they win? How pusillanimous Pompey is!
They say that he is thinking of Egypt and Arabia Felix and Mesopotamia

CICERO THE IMPERATOR TO CAESAR THE IMPERATOR, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Formiae, March 19_, B.C. _49_]

On reading your letter, which I got from our friend Furnius, in which
you told me to come near Rome, I was not much surprised at your wishing
to employ "my advice and my position"; but I asked myself what you
meant by my "influence" and "help." However, my hopes led me to think
that a man of your admirable statesmanship would wish to act for the
comfort, peace, and agreement of the citizens, and for that purpose I
considered my own character and inclination very suitable. If that is
the case, and if you are touched by the desire to protect our friend
Pompey and reconcile him to yourself and the State, I am sure you
will find no one more suited for the purpose than I am. I have always
advocated peace both with Pompey and the Senate ever since I have been
able to do so, nor since the outbreak of hostilities have I taken any
part in the war; I have considered that the war was attacking your
rights in that envious and hostile persons were opposing a distinction
conferred on you by the grace of the Roman people. But, as at that time
I not only upheld your rights but urged others to assist you, so now I
am greatly concerned with the rights of Pompey. It is

ut tuo beneficio bonus vir, gratus, pius denique esse in maximi

et ad rem publicam pertinet, me et pacis et utriusque vestrum amicum,

me gratissimo animo de tua liberalitate beneficioque misit, eandem mi

be my closest friends, as you are. So I ask you, or rather beseech
and entreat you with all urgency, that in spite of all your anxieties
you may devote some time to considering how I may be enabled by your
kindness to be what decency and gratitude, nay good-feeling, require,
in remembering my great debt to Pompey. If this only mattered to
myself, I should yet hope to obtain my request; but to my mind it
touches your honour and the public weal that I, a friend of peace and
of both of you, should be so supported by you that I may be able to
work for peace between you and peace amongst our fellow-citizens. I
thanked you formerly in the matter of Lentulus, for having saved him,
as he had saved me. Yet on reading the letter he has sent me full of
thankfulness for your generous kindness, I feel that his safety is my
debt as much as his. If you understand my gratitude to him, pray give
me the opportunity of showing my gratitude to Pompey too.

I had just read your letter on the 20th, when an epistle was brought to
me from Lepta announcing that Pompey was blockaded and that even escape
from the harbour was cut off by a fleet. Upon my honour tears prevent
me from thinking or writing anything else. I send you a copy of the
letter. Wretches that we are, why did we not all follow his fortunes
together? See now, here are Matius and Trebatius with the same tidings.

evigilata tuis cogitationibus qua itineris, qua navigationis, qua

De Dionysio sum admiratus, qui apud me honoratior fuit quam apud
Scipionem Panaetius; a quo impurissime haec nostra fortuna despecta
est. Odi hominem et odero; utinam ulcisci possem! Sed illum ulciscentur
mores sui.

Tu, quaeso, nunc vel maxime, quid agendum nobis sit, cogita. Populi
Romani exercitus Cn. Pompeium circumsedet, fossa et vallo saeptum
tenet, fuga prohibet; nos vivimus, et stat urbs ista, praetores ius
dicunt, aediles ludos parant; viri boni usuras perscribunt, ego ipse
sedeo! Coner illuc ire ut insanus, implorare fidem municipiorum?
Boni non sequentur, leves irridebunt, rerum novarum cupidi, victores
praesertim et armati, vim et manus adferent. Quid censes igitur?
ecquidnam est tui consilii ad finem huius miserrimae vitae? Nunc doleo,
nunc torqueor, cum cuidam aut sapiens videor, quod una non ierim, aut
felix fuisse. Mihi contra. Numquam enim illius victoriae socius esse
volui, calamitatis mallem fuisse. Quid ego nunc tuas litteras, quid
tuam prudentiam aut benevolentiam implorem? Actum est; nulla re iam
possum iuvari,

sorrow, so that now I would choose the end of Mucius.[100] But how
honourable, how simple, how clearly thought out was your advice as to
my land-route and my sea-route and my meeting and talk with Caesar! It
was equally honourable and prudent. Your invitation, too, to Epirus,
how kind and generous and brotherly it is!

[100] Q. Mucius Scaevola was murdered in 82 B.C. by the order of the
younger Marius. Cf. viii, 3.

As for Dionysius, I am surprised. I held him in greater honour than
Scipio held Panaetius, yet he has most foully mocked at my bad
fortunes. I hate the fellow and I always shall. I wish I could pay him
out. But his own character will do that.

I beseech you now give the greatest consideration to my proper course.
An army of the Roman people invests Gnaeus Pompey. It holds him hedged
by trench and mound and keeps him from flight. Yet we live and Rome is
standing, the praetors preside in court, the aediles make preparations
for the games, the conservatives are booking their profits, and I sit
still! Am I to try to cross the sea like a madman, to beg the country
towns to be loyal? The loyalists will not follow me, the irresponsible
will deride me, the revolutionaries, especially now they are armed and
victorious, will lay hands of violence upon me. What do you think then?
Have you any plan to end this life of misery? Now I feel grief, now I
am in agony, when somebody thinks me wise because I did not go with
Pompey, or lucky perhaps. I think the opposite. For never did I wish
to share a victory of his; I should have wished rather to share his
defeat. Why should I entreat a letter from you now, your kindness, your
good sense? It is all over. Nothing can help me

Οὐκ ἔστ' ἔτυμος λόγος, ut opinor, ille de ratibus. Quid enim esset,
quod Dolabella iis litteris, quas iii Idus Martias a Brundisio dedit,
hanc quasi εὐημερίαν Caesaris scriberet, Pompeium in fuga esse eumque
primo vento navigaturum? Quod valde discrepat ab iis epistulis, quarum

"'Tis no true tale"[101] to my mind that about the fleet. For why
should Dolabella in a letter dated from Brundisium on the 13th of
March call it a kind of windfall for Caesar that Pompey is thinking of
flight and preparing to sail by the first wind? That is very different
from that letter of which I sent you a copy before. Here indeed every
one speaks of sheer disaster; but there is no later nor more reliable
authority on the event than Dolabella.

[101] The first line of the palinode of Stesichorus in which he
retracted his former views on Helen.

I have your letter of the 22nd of March, in which you postpone all
advice till we know what has happened. Certainly that is wise; and in
the meantime we cannot think of anything, much less arrange anything.
However, Dolabella's letter compels me to turn to my former thoughts.
For on the 18th of March the weather was excellent and I fancy Pompey
will not have failed to take advantage of it.

That précis of your advice was not made by me to quarrel with you, but
to console myself, for I suffered less pain from these evil days than
from the idea I had acted wrongly and rashly. But I fancy I have not
done so, since my deeds and policy agree with your advice. You say that
I seem to owe Pompey so much more because I say so than because he
deserves it. You are right. I have always exaggerated

Nihil me adiuvit, cum posset; sed postea fuit amicus, etiam valde,

illud par in utroque nostrum, quod ab eisdem illecti sumus. Sed utinam

ista videre, quae tu potes iam animo providere, nec interesse istis
malis possem. Sed eo tardior ad discedendum fui, quod difficile est de
discessu voluntario sine ulla spe reditus cogitare. Nam ego hunc ita
paratum video peditatu, equitatu, classibus, auxiliis Gallorum, quos
Matius ἐλάπιζεν, ut puto, sed certe dicebat....[102] peditum, equitum
se polliceri sumptu suo annos decem. Sed sit hoc λάπισμα; magnas habet
certe copias et habebit non Italiae vectigal, sed civium bona. Adde

his services for fear he might think I remembered the past. However
much I remembered it, I should feel bound to take the course he took
as an example for my behaviour now. He failed to help me when he
might; but afterwards he was my friend, my very good friend. I don't
quite know why; so I too will be his friend. There is this further
likeness between the two cases; both of us were inveigled by the same
persons. But would that I were able to help him as much as he was
able to help me! However, I am truly grateful for what he did. I do
not know in what way I may be able to help him now; nor, were I able,
should I think it proper to help him in his preparations for such a
disastrous war. Only I do not wish to hurt his feelings by staying
here. I declare I could not behold the days that you can foresee, nor
take part in such iniquity. But my departure was delayed, because
it is hard to think of voluntary departure when there is no hope of
return. For Caesar I see is so equipped with infantry, cavalry, fleet,
auxiliaries from Gaul--Matius may have exaggerated, but certainly
he said that ... infantry and cavalry have promised their services
for ten years at their own expense. However, granted that this was
_gasconnade_, great forces Caesar assuredly has, and he will have not
the inland revenue of Italy, but the property of her citizens. Add to
this the self-confidence of the man, the weakness of the loyalists,
who, thinking Pompey deservedly angry with them, as you say, detest the
game. I wish you had cited your authority. Domitius, who promised more
than he performed,[104] and Pompey's old lovers in general do

not love him. The towns and rural population are afraid of Pompey and
so far worship Caesar. Caesar is so equipped that, even if he fail
to beat, I do not see in what way he can be beaten. I do not fear
his _finesse_ so much as his _force majeure_, for as Plato says, "a
tyrant's requests partake of the nature of mandates."[105]

Places without harbours, I see, do not meet with your approval. Nor do
I like them, but the place has afforded me hiding and a trusty set of
attendants. If I could have had the same at Brundisium, I should have
preferred it. But there is no hiding place there. But, as you say, when
we know!

I am not going to excuse myself much to the loyalists. What dinners
according to Sextus they are giving and receiving, how lavish and how
early! They may be loyal, but they are not more loyal than I. They
would influence me more if they had shown more courage.

I was wrong about Phamea's estate at Lanuvium. I was dreaming about
the Trojan estate.[106] I wanted it for £4,500,[107] but the price is
higher. However, I should have liked you to buy that estate for me, if
I saw any hope of enjoying it.

What portentous news I read daily you may understand from the pamphlet
enclosed in this packet. Lentulus is at Puteoli, and, Caesius says, in
a quandary what to do. He dreads a fiasco like that at Corfinium. He
thinks he has done his duty by Pompey. He is influenced by Caesar's
kindness; but he is influenced more by future prospects.

To think that you can bear this! Everything is

speak of peace, and yet he is under siege. I did not believe it; but I
have a letter from Balbus of which I send you a copy. Read it, please,
and that clause at the end which contains the remarks of the good
Balbus himself, to whom Pompey gave a site for his estate and whom he
had often preferred to all of us. So he is in an agony of grief. But,
that you may not have to read the same, twice over, I refer you to the
letter. Of peace I have no hope. Dolabella in his letter of the 13th
of March speaks of war pure and simple. So let us stick to the same
opinion, that there is no hope, for nothing can be worse than all this.

Caesar has sent me a very short letter of which I subjoin a copy. From
the shortness of the letter you can infer that he is greatly occupied,
to write so briefly about a matter of such importance. If there is any
further news, I will write you immediately.

"On the 9th of March I came to Brundisium, and under its walls pitched

When I have hopes of settled terms, I will inform you immediately."

My dear Cicero, you can imagine my torture, after I again had hopes
of peace, for fear anything should prevent an arrangement. I long for
peace. It is all I can do in my absence from the scene of action.

[Sidenote: _Formiae March 25_, B.C. _49_]

I sent you on the 26th of March a copy of Balbus' letter to me and of
Caesar's letter to him. Then that very day from Capua I got a letter
from Q. Pedius saying that Caesar had written to him on the 14th in the
following terms:

"Pompey confines himself to the town. My camp is at the gates. I am
attempting a big job which will take many days on account of the depth
of the sea: yet I have no better course. From both wings of the harbour
I am building a mole, so that I may either compel him to transship the
forces he has here as soon as possible, or prevent him from getting out
at all."

Where is the peace about which Balbus wrote that he was tormenting
himself? Could anything be more bitter, more cruel? Moreover some one
told me with authority that Caesar said in conversation he was the
avenger of Cn. Carbo, M. Brutus,[109] and all those on whom Sulla with
Pompey to help him wreaked his cruelty: Curio under his leadership was
doing nothing but what Pompey had done under Sulla's leadership: what
he wanted was the restoration of those not punished with exile under
the earlier laws, while Pompey had restored those who had

[109] Carbo was put to death by Pompey in 82 or 81 B.C.; he was consul
for the third time with C. Marius the younger. Brutus, the father of
Caesar's murderer, was killed by Pompey in 77 or 76 B.C., and another
M. Brutus committed suicide sooner than fall into his hands.

been traitors: he resents Pompey's violent banishment of Milo, but
would only harm those who bear arms against him. This tale was told me
by one Baebius, who came from Curio on the 13th, a man who is no fool,
but not smart enough to invent such a tale. I am quite at a loss what
to do. From Brundisium, I fancy Pompey must have set out. Whatever has
happened, we shall know in a few days. I haven't a letter from you not
even by Anteros, and no wonder. What is there to write about? Still I
do not omit one day.

When this was written a letter came to me before daylight from Lepta
dated Capua the 15th of March. Pompey has embarked from Brundisium.
Caesar is due at Capua on the 26th.

After I had sent you a letter informing you that Caesar would be at
Capua on the 26th, a letter reached me from Capua saying that Caesar
would see me either here or in Curio's place at Alba on the 28th.
When I have seen him, I shall go to Arpinum. If he should grant me
the privilege I ask, I shall put up with his terms. If not, then I
shall consult myself as to what to do. As Caesar wrote to me, he has
stationed one legion each at Brundisium, Tarentum and Sipontum. He
seems to me to be cutting off retreat by sea and yet himself to have
Greece in view rather than Spain. But these are remote considerations.
Now I am stirred by the thought of meeting him; for the meeting is
close at hand, and I am alarmed at the first steps he

horreo. Volet enim, credo, S. C. facere, volet augurum decretum
(rapiemur aut absentes vexabimur), vel ut consules roget praetor vel
ut dictatorem dicat; quorum neutrum ius est. Etsi, si Sulla potuit
efficere, ab interrege ut dictator diceretur[112] cur hic non possit?
Nihil expedio, nisi ut aut ab hoc tamquam Q. Mucius aut ab illo tamquam
L. Scipio.

will take, for he will want, I am sure, a decree of the Senate and a
decree of the augurs (we shall be hurried off to Rome or harassed, if
we are absent), so that the praetor may hold an election of consuls or
name a dictator, both acts unconstitutional. Though, if Sulla could
arrange to be named dictator by an interrex, why should not Caesar? I
can see no solution of the problem except by meeting the fate of Mucius
at the hand of Caesar, or that of Scipio[113] at the hands of Pompey.

[113] L. Scipio was proscribed by Sulla. For Mucius cf. VIII, 3.

When you read this, perhaps I shall have met the man. "Endure." My
own exile was no "unkinder cut";[114] for I had prospects of speedy
return and was consoled by the popular outcry. Now I long to go away
and it never strikes me that there is any chance of return. Not only
is there no outcry of any in town or country, but on the contrary all
are afraid of Pompey as cruel in his anger. Nothing causes me more
wretchedness than my having remained, and there is nothing that I want
more than to flee to him to share not his fighting but his flight. But
now what becomes of your counsel to put off decision till we knew how
things went at Brundisium? We do know, but are as badly stuck as ever.
I can scarcely hope that Caesar will give me privilege, though many
are the good reasons I can bring for granting it. But I will send you
immediately a report of our conversation word for word. Use all your
affection to help me with your careful advise. He is coming so fast
that I cannot see even T. Rebilus, as I had arranged. I

have to do everything impromptu. But nevertheless as the poet has it,
"Some things I'll venture and some things God will prompt." Whatever
I do you shall know forthwith. The demands Caesar sent to Pompey and
the consuls, for which you ask, are not with me. The copies that were
brought I sent on to you at once.[116] From them I think you can gather
what those demands were. Philippus is at Naples. Lentulus at Puteoli.
As to Domitius, go on inquiring where he is and what he intends to do.

[116] This doubtful passage probably refers to the document mentioned
in vii, 17.

You write that my remarks about Dionysius are more bitter than suits my
character. See how old-fashioned I am. Upon my honour I thought that
you would be more angered than I: for, apart from the fact that I think
you should be stirred by any injury done by anyone to me, this man in a
way outraged you in treating me so badly. But it is for you to decide
what weight you should give to the matter. I will not put anything upon
you. I always thought the fellow was not quite sane: now I think he is
an abandoned blackguard. But he is as much his own enemy as mine. You
did well with Philargyrus. You certainly had a good and true case in
contending that I had not abandoned but rather had been abandoned.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Formiae, March 27_, B.C. _49_]

I am awaiting Trebatius on March the 27th, the date of this letter.
From his tidings and Matius' letter I shall consider how to talk to
Caesar. What a wretched age this is! I have no doubt Caesar will urge
me to come to Rome. For he gave orders that notices should be posted
even at Formiae that he wanted a full house on the 1st. Must I refuse?
But why do I anticipate? I will write you all about it at once. From
Caesar's conversation I shall decide whether I ought to go to Arpinum
or elsewhere. I wish to celebrate my son's coming of age. Arpinum, I
think, will be the place. Please consider what I should do next, for
my troubles have made me stupid. From Curius I want to hear whether
you have had news about Tiro. For to me Tiro has written in such a way
that I am anxious to know how he is. Those two who come from his part
say that his condition is critical. In the midst of many great troubles
this also distresses me; for in our present straits his energy and
loyalty would be very serviceable.

Utrumque ex tuo consilio; nam et oratio fuit ea nostra, ut bene potius
ille de nobis existimaret quam gratias ageret, et in eo mansimus,
ne ad urbem. Illa fefellerunt, facilem quod putaramus. Nihil vidi
minus. Damnari se nostro iudicio, tardiores fore reliquos, si nos non
veniremus, dicere. Ego dissimilem illorum esse causam. Cum multa,
"Veni igitur et age de pace." "Meone," inquam, "arbitratu?" "An tibi,"
inquit, "ego praescribam?" "Sic," inquam, "agam, senatui non placere
in Hispanias iri nec exercitus in Graeciam transportari, multaque,"
inquam, "de Gnaeo deplorabo." Tum ille: "Ego vero ista dici nolo." "Ita
putabam," inquam; "sed ego eo nolo adesse, quod aut sic mihi dicendum
est, multaque, quae nullo modo possem silere, si adessem, aut non
veniendum." Summa fuit, ut ille quasi exitum quaerens, ut deliberarem.
Non fuit negandum. Ita discessimus. Credo igitur hunc me non amare. At
ego me amavi, quod mihi iam pridem usu non venit.

In both respects I followed your advice. I spoke so as to gain Caesar's
respect rather than his gratitude; and I persisted in my resolve not to
go to Rome. We were mistaken in thinking he would be easy to manage. I
have never seen anyone less easy. He kept on saying that my decision
was a slur on him, and that others would be less likely to come, if I
did not come. I pointed out that my case was very unlike theirs. After
much talk he said, "Well, come and discuss peace." "On my own terms?"
I asked. "Need I dictate to you?" said he. "Well," said I, "I shall
contend that the Senate cannot sanction your invasion of Spain or your
going with an army into Greece, and," I added, "I shall lament Pompey's
fate." He replied, "That is not what I want." "So I fancied," said I:
"but I do not want to be in Rome, because either I must say that and
much else, on which I cannot keep silent, if I am present, or else I
cannot come." The upshot was that I was to think over the matter, as
Caesar suggested, with a view to closing our interview. I could not
refuse. So we parted. I am confident then he has no liking for me. But
I like myself, as I have not for a long time.

For the rest, ye gods what a following! What _âmes damnées_ in your
phrase! Celer is an hero to the rest. What an abandoned cause, and what
desperate gangs! What can one think of a son of Servius and a son of
Titinius being in an army which beset Pompey? Six legions! He is very
wide-awake and

Hoc fuerat extremum.

Illa tamen κατακλεὶς illius est odiosa, quam paene praeterii, si sibi
consiliis nostris uti non liceret, usurum, quorum posset, ad omniaqae
esse descensurum. "Vidisti igitur virum, ut scripseras? ingemuisti?"
Certe. "Cedo reliqua." Quid? Continuo ipse in Pedanum, ego Arpinum.
Inde exspecto equidem λαλαγεῦσαν[117] illam tuam. "Tu malim," inquies,
"actum ne agas." Etiam illum ipsum, quem sequimur, multa fefellerunt.

Sed ego tuas litteras exspecto. Nihil est enim iam ut antea "Videamus,

non dubito quin istum offfenderim. Eo maturius agendum est. Amabo te,

Ego meo Ciceroni, quoniam Roma earemus, Arpini potissimum togam puram

bold. I see no end to our evil days. Now assuredly you must produce
your advice. This was the limit we contemplated.

Caesar's _finale_, which I had almost forgotten, was hateful:--"If I
may not use your advice, I shall use the advice I can and go to any
length." You will say: "You have seen him to be as you have described
him: and did you heave a sigh?" Indeed I did. You ask for the rest of
our talk. What more is there to tell? He went straight to Pedum, I to
Arpinum. From thence I await the "twittering swallow"[118] you talk of.
You will say you prefer me not to dwell on past mistakes. Even Pompey,
our leader, has made many.

"Fair is the season for sailing: already the twittering swallow
Flitteth around, and soft bloweth the wind from the west." Cf. _Att._

But I await a letter from you. There is no room now, as before, for
your "await the event." The limit we fixed was that interview; and I
have no doubt I annoyed Caesar; so I must act the more quickly. Please
send me a letter and deal with _la haute politique_. I await a letter
from you now very anxiously.

Since Rome was out of bounds, I celebrated my son's coming of age at
Arpinum in preference to any other place, and so doing delighted my
fellow-townsmen. Though they were pleased, yet I must tell you they and
all others I have met are sad and sorry.

tam atrox est ἀναθεώρησις huius ingentis mali. Dilectus habentur, in
hiberna deducuntur. Ea, quae, etiam cum a bonis viris, cum iusto in
bello, cum modeste fiunt, tamen ipsa per se molesta sunt, quam censes
acerba nunc esse, cum a perditis in civili nefario bello petulantissime
fiant! Cave autem putes quemquam hominem in Italia turpem esse, qui
hinc absit. Vidi ipse Formiis universos neque mehercule umquam homines
putavi, et noram omnes, sed numquam uno loco videram.

Pergamus igitur, quo placet, et nostra omnia relinquamus, proficiscamur
ad eum, cui gratior noster adventus erit, quam si una fuissemus. Tum
enim eramus in maxima spe, nunc ego quidem in nulla; nec praeter me
quisquam Italia cessit, nisi qui hunc inimicum sibi putaret. Nec
mehercule hoc facio rei publicae causa, quam funditus deletam puto, sed
ne quis me putet ingratum in eum, qui me levavit iis incommodis, quibus
idem adfecerat, et simul quod ea, quae fiunt, aut quae certe futura
sunt, videre non possum. Etiam equidem senatus consulta facta quaedam
iam puto, utinam in Volcaci sententiam! Sed quid refert? est enim una
sententia omnium. Sed erit immitissimus Servius, qui filium misit ad
effligendum Cn. Pompeium aut certe capiendum cum Pontio Titiniano. Etsi
hic quidem timoris causa, ille vero?

So dark and direful is the _coup d'oeil_ of this vast calamity. Levies
are being made; troops are being drafted into winter quarters. These
measures are hardships in themselves even when taken by loyalists, when
the war is just, when there is some consideration. You can imagine how
bitter they are when taken quite tyrannically by desperadoes in wicked
civil war. But you must remember that every scoundrel in Italy is of
the party. I saw them all together at Formiae. I could hardly believe
them to be human. I knew every one of them, but I had never seen the
whole collection together.

Let us go then whither we please, and leave our all behind. Let us set
out to Pompey, who will be more gratified at our arrival than if we
had been with him all along. For then we had great hopes; but now I
at least have none: nor has anyone except myself departed from Italy,
unless he imagines Caesar to be his enemy. Heaven be my witness I do
not take this step for the sake of the Republic, which to my mind is
utterly destroyed, but for fear I may be charged with ingratitude
to one who relieved me from the inconveniences which he himself had
inflicted: and, at the same time, because I cannot endure the sight
of the horrors that are happening and are bound to happen. Moreover
I fancy that now decrees of the Senate have been passed, and my only
hope is that they will agree with Volcacius' proposal. But what does
it matter? There is only one proposal for everybody. But the most
implacable enemy will be Servius, who has sent his son with Pontius
Titinianus to destroy or at least to capture Gnaeus Pompey. Though
Titinianus has the excuse of fear, what excuse has Servius? But let us
cease

Nos, quoniam superum mare obsidetur, infero navigabimus, et, si
Puteolis erit difficile, Crotonem petemus aut Thurios et boni cives
amantes patriae mare infestum habebimus. Aliam rationem huius belli
gerendi nullam video. In Aegyptum nos abdemus. Exercitu pares esse non
possumus; pacis fides nulla est. Sed haec satis deplorata sunt.

from anger and let us reflect that there is nothing left us now except
what to me is least desirable--life.

As for me, since the Adriatic is beset, I shall sail by the lower sea,
and, if it be difficult to start from Puteoli, I shall seek Croton or
Thurii, and like a loyal and patriotic citizen play the pirate. Other
means of conducting this war I see none. We will go and bury ourselves
in Egypt. We cannot match Caesar on land, and we cannot rely on peace.
But enough of this outcry.

Please entrust a letter to Cephalio about all that has been done, and
even about people's talk, unless men have become quite dumb. I followed
your advice, especially when I maintained in our conversation a proper
dignity and persisted in my refusal to go to Rome. For the rest please
write to me in as much detail as possible (for the worst has come to
the worst) what you approve and what you think, though now there can be
no doubt. But yet, if anything comes into your mind, or rather whatever
comes into your mind, please write to me.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Laterium, April 3_, B.C. _49_]

[Sidenote: Iliad XXII, 304]

On the third of April coming to my brother's house at Laterium, I got
your letter with some little relief, a thing which had not happened to
me since this disaster began. For I attach very great weight to your
approval of my firmness of mind and my action. As for your writing
that it meets with the approval of my friend Sextus, I am as glad as
if I fancied myself to have won the approval of his father, on whose
judgement I always set the very highest value. I often call to mind how
it was he who said to me on that famous December the 5th, when I asked
him what we were to do next: "Let me not die a coward and shameful
death, but greatly daring live in fame for aye." So his influence lives
for me, and his son, who is very like him, has the same weight as he.
Please give him my best compliments.

Your plan, it is true, you postpone for a very short time,--for I fancy
by now that that venal peace-maker must have wound up his speech, and
something must have been done in the session of Senators, for I don't
consider it a Senate,--still you keep mine in suspense, but the less so
because I have no doubt as to what you think we should do. For when you
write that Flavius is offered a legion and Sicily, and that the matter
is now in hand, just think what

       *       *       *       *       *

                                Page 274

partim parari iam et cogitari, partim ex tempore futura censes? Ego
vero Solonis, popularis tui, ut puto, etiam mei, legem neglegam, qui
capite sanxit, si qui in seditione non alterius utrius partis fuisset,
et, nisi si tu aliter censes, et hinc abero et illim. Sed alterum mihi
est certius, nec praeripiam tamen. Exspectabo tuum consilium et eas
litteras, nisi alias iam dedisti, quas scripsi ut Cephalioni dares.

Quod scribis, non quo aliunde audieris, sed te ipsum putare me
attractum iri, si de pace agatur, mihi omnino non venit in mentem,
quae possit actio esse de pace, cum illi certissimum sit, si possit,
exspoliare exercitu et provincia Pompeium; nisi forte iste nummarius
ei potest persuadere, ut, dum oratores eant, redeant, quiescat. Nihil
video, quod sperem aut quod iam putem fieri posse. Sed tamen hominis
hoc ipsum probi est et magnum τι[119] τῶν πολιτικωτάτων σκεμμάτων,
veniendumne sit in consilium tyranni, si is aliqua de re bona
deliberaturus sit. Quare, si quid eius modi evenerit, ut arcessamur
(quod equidem non credo.[120] Quid enim essem de pace dicturus, dixi;
ipse valde repudiavit), sed tamen, si quid acciderit, quid censeas
mihi faciendum, utique scribito. Nihil enini mihi adhuc accidit, quod
maioris consilii esset.

[119] et magnum τι _Wesenberg_; magnum sit _MSS._

[120] credo _Boot_: curo _MSS._

iniquities are being prepared and meditated, some now and some in the
future? I shall certainly neglect the law of Solon, your countryman,
and I imagine mine too soon, who provided the death penalty for
anyone who should not take one side in a revolution, and, unless you
advise otherwise, I shall keep apart both from Caesar and Pompey. The
former course is quite certain: but I shall not forestall events. I
shall await your advice and the letter which I asked you to give to
Cephalio--unless you have now sent another.

You write, not on the authority of anyone, but as your own idea,
that I shall be drawn into any negotiations there may be for peace.
I cannot imagine that there can be such negotiations, since it is
Caesar's positive determination to rob Pompey, if possible, of army and
province, unless perhaps that hireling can induce him to keep quiet,
pending the passage to and fro of intermediaries. I see nothing that
I can hope for or even imagine is likely to happen. However this is
the very question for an honest man to decide and one of the great
questions of _la haute politique_, whether one may enter the council
of a tyrant, if the subject of debate is good. Therefore, if anything
should happen to cause me to be summoned--I don't in the least expect
anything will, for I have said all I can say about peace, and Caesar
was determined to repudiate it--still, if anything should happen, write
and tell me what you think I should do in any case. For so far nothing
has happened that demands greater deliberation.

I am glad you are pleased with the words of that loyal citizen
Trebatius, and your frequent bravos have so far been my sole pleasure.
Your letter I

gravitatem eandem, quam mihi praecipis. Celer tuus disertus magis
est quam sapiens. De iuvenibus quae ex Tullia audisti, vera sunt.
Mucianum[121] istud, quod scribis, non mihi videtur tam re esse triste
quam verbo. Haec est ἄλη, in qua nunc sumus, mortis instar. Aut enim

Aut oportet temeritatem bonorum sequamur aut audaciam improborum

tamen tutum.

await eagerly. I expect it has been dispatched now. With Sextus you
have preserved the same dignity that you prescribe for me. Your friend
Celer has more wit than wisdom. What you heard from Tullia about the
boys is true. Mucius' ending,[122] which you mention, does not seem to
me so sad as it sounds. It is this distraction in which we now find
ourselves that is like death. For I have the alternative, either to
take part in politics with a free hand among the disloyal, or to side
with the loyal at all costs. I ought either to follow the loyalists in
their rashness or attack the other party in its daring. Either course
spells danger: but my present action brings shame without safety.

[122] Cf. ix, 12.

The man who sent his son to Brundisium to negotiate peace (my views
on peace are yours, that it is patent pretence, but that war is being
prosecuted with the utmost activity) that man I think and not I will be
chosen as commissioner. So far to my relief I have heard nothing. So
I fancy it less necessary to write or consider my possible course of
action, if I should happen to be chosen.

I received your letter brought by Cephalio on the 5th of April. The
next day I intended to stop at Menturnae, and to return thence at once.
I halted at my brother's place at Arcanum in order that I might be in a
more retired place till I get certain news and that such preparations
for the journey, as did not need my presence, might be made.

The "bird that twitters of flight"[123] is here and I am afire with
eagerness, though I have no idea of destination or route. But these
will be considered by me and by those who know. You however must assist
me with your advice, so far as possible, as you have before. The tangle
cannot be unravelled. Everything must be entrusted to fortune. We are
simply struggling without hope. If anything better happens, I shall
be surprised. I would rather Dionysius did not come to me: Tullia has
written to me about him. The time is unsuitable, and I should prefer
that discomforts as great as mine should not be seen by a man who is
not my friend. But I do not want you to be his enemy on my account.

Though I have nothing at all to write about, yet these points remain,
which I want to know. Has Caesar started? In what condition has he
left Rome? In Italy itself whom has he placed in charge of each region
or department? Who were sent to Pompey and the consuls as peace
commissioners according to the decree of the Senate? To make these
inquiries I have taken the trouble to send this letter. So you will do
well and please me, if you inform me on these points and of anything
else which I ought to know. I stay in Arcanum till I get information.

A. d. VII Idus alteram tibi eodem die hanc epistulam dictavi et pridie

Caesar mihi ignoscit per litteras, quod non venerim, seseque in optimam

On the 7th of April I dictate this letter, the second on the same day,
and yesterday I dispatched a longer one in my own handwriting. It is
said you have been seen in the Regia,[124] and I don't blame you, since
I laid myself open to the same blame. But I await a letter from you. I
don't see what news I can expect; but still, even if there is none, I
wish you would just tell me that.

[124] The official residence of Caesar as _Pontifex maximus_.

Caesar has written to excuse me for not coming to Rome, and says
that he takes it in good part. I am not concerned at his saying that
Titinius and Servius have complained to him for not allowing them the
same privilege as he did to me. What fools they are! They send their
sons to besiege Pompey, and themselves hesitate to enter the House.
However, I send you a copy of Caesar's letter.

I have received a lot of letters from you on the same day, all of them
written with care and one, which is as big as a book, worth reading
several times, as I am doing. Your labour has not been in vain: you
have gratified me very much. And so I beseech you continue to write as
often as you can, so long as it is possible, that is, so long as you
know where I am. And as for our daily lamentations let us make an end
of them once for all, if we can, or at

quem vitae statum amiserim, cogito, sed quid consecutus sim, quid

nihil contra huius voluntatem facere posse, elapsus e soceri manibus

cum pium tum etiam necessarium, suis tamen civibus exitiabile, nisi

qua illi florentissima, nos duriore conflictati videmur. Quis enim

any rate moderate them, which we certainly can. For I have given up
thinking of the dignity, the honours and the position I have lost:
I think of what I have attained, what I have done, the glory of my
career, in short what a difference there is even in our present straits
between me and those through whom I have lost all. They are the people
who thought they could not attain their extravagant desires without
expelling me from the State: and you see now what has come of their
coalition in a criminal conspiracy.

The one burns with a madman's lust for crime, which does not cool one
whit, but rather increases day by day. He has just driven Pompey from
Italy, now on one side of the world he is pursuing him, on the other he
is trying to rob him of his province: and he no longer refuses, nay,
he practically demands, to be called a tyrant, as he is. The other,
who once would not even give me a helping hand, when I threw myself at
his feet, declaring he could do nothing against Caesar's will, now,
having slipped from the grasp of his father-in-law's mailed hand, is
preparing war by land and sea. The war is not unjust on his part, nay,
it is even righteous and necessary; but, unless he conquers, it will
be fatal to his fellow-countrymen; and, even if he does conquer, it
will be disastrous. These are our great men; but I do not hold their
achievements one whit superior to mine, nor even their fortune, though
they may seem to have basked in fortune's smiles while I have met her
frowns. For who can be happy, when he has caused his country to be
deserted or enslaved? And if, as you admonish me, I was right in saying
in those books of mine that nothing is good, save

what is honourable, and nothing bad, save what is dishonourable, then
certainly both of them are most miserable, since both of them have
thought less of their country's safety and dignity than of their own
high place and private interests. My conscience then is clear and helps
to support me, when I think that I have always rendered my country
good service, when I could, and assuredly have never harboured any but
loyal thoughts, and that the State has been wrecked by the very storm
which I foresaw fourteen years ago. With a clear conscience then I
shall depart, though the parting will cost me a bitter pang: nor shall
I go so much for my own sake or for my brother's--our day is done--as
for our children, to whom I think at times we ought to have secured
at least a free country. For one of them I feel the most poignant
grief--not so much because he is my son, as because he is exceedingly
dutiful--while the other unfortunately has turned out the bitterest
disappointment of my life. He has been spoiled, I suppose, by our
indulgence, and has gone to lengths that I dare not name. I am waiting
for your letter too; for you promised to write more fully when you
had seen him himself. All my humouring of him has been accompanied by
considerable strictness: and I have had to put my foot down not over
one fault of his or a small one, but over many grave faults. But his
father's kindness should surely have been repaid by affection rather
than by such cruel disregard. For we were more annoyed at his sending
letters to Caesar than we let you see, but I think we made his life a
burden to him. I dare not describe this recent journey of his and his
hypocritical pretence of filial duty: I only know that, after he met
Hirtius,

arcessitum a Caesare, cum eo de meo animo a suis rationibus alienissimo
et consilio relinquendi Italiam; et haec ipsa timide. Sed nulla nostra
culpa est, natura metuenda est. Haec Curionem, haec Hortensi filium,
non patrum culpa corrupit.

Iacet in maerore meus frater neque tam de sua vita quam de mea metuit.
Huic tu huic tu malo adfer consolationes, si ullas potes; maxime quidem
illam velim, ea, quae ad nos delata sint, aut falsa esse aut minora.
Quae si vera sint, quid futurum sit in hac vita et fuga, nescio.
Nam, si haberemus rem publicam, consilium mihi non deesset nec ad
severitatem nec ad indulgentiam. Nunc haec sive iracundia sive dolore
sive metu permotus gravius scripsi, quam aut tuus in illum amor aut
meus postulabat, si vera sunt, ignosces, si falsa, me libente eripies
mihi hunc errorem. Quoquo modo vero se res habebit, nihil adsignabis
nec patruo nec patri.

Cum haec scripsissem, a Curione mihi nuntiatum est eum ad me venire.
Venerat enim is in Cumanum vesperi pridie, id est Idibus. Si quid
igitur eius modi sermo eius attulerit, quod ad te scribendum sit, id
his litteris adiungam.

Praeteriit villam meam Curio iussitque mihi nuntiari mox se venturum
cucurritque Puteolos, ut ibi contionaretur. Contionatus est, rediit,
fuit ad me sane diu. O rem foedam! Nosti hominem; nihil occultavit, in
primis nihil esse certius, quam ut

he was summoned to Caesar's presence, and discussed the difference
between my views and his own and my plan of leaving Italy. Even
that I write with hesitation. But it is no fault of mine: it is his
disposition which must cause us anxiety. That is what corrupted Curio
and Hortensius' son, not their fathers' fault.

My brother is prostrate with grief, though he does not fear for his own
life so much as for mine. It is to him, to him more than me, I want you
to offer consolation, if you can. The best consolation would be that
what we have heard was false or exaggerated. If it was true, I fail to
see what will come of this runaway existence. For if the constitution
were still intact, I should know what to do both in the way of severity
and in the way of kindness. Now, under the sway of some passion, be it
wrath or sorrow or fear, I have written more bitterly than either your
affection for him or mine warrants. If what I have said is true, you
will pardon me: if it is false, I shall be only too glad to have the
error removed. However it may be, you must not blame his uncle or his
father.

When I had got so far, I received a message from Curio that he was
coming to see me. He came to his place here yesterday evening, that
is on the 13th. If any point worth mentioning to you occurs in our
conversation, I will add it to this letter.

Curio passed by my house, and sent a message saying he was coming very
soon. Then he hurried off to make a speech at Puteoli. He made his
speech, returned and stayed a very long time. How disgusting! You know
the sort of man he is: he hid nothing. In the first place he is quite
sure that all

those condemned by Pompey's law are going to be recalled: and so he is
going to make use of their services in Sicily. He had no doubt about
Caesar getting the two Spains and said he would start from them with
an army to wherever Pompey might be. Pompey's death would be the end
of the war. Caesar had been carried away by anger into wishing to have
the tribune Metellus killed and he had had a narrow shave. If it had
happened, there would have been an enormous massacre. Many had spoken
in favour of a massacre: and Caesar himself was not by nature and
inclination averse to cruelty, but he thought that mild measures would
win popularity. But, if he lost popular favour, he would be cruel. He
had been put out when he found that he had offended the populace itself
by seizing the treasury: and so, though he had fully made up his mind
to harangue the people before leaving, he had not ventured to do so,
and he had gone off in a very disturbed state of mind. But when I asked
Curio what he looked forward to, what end, and what constitution, he
confessed openly that there was no hope left. He was afraid of Pompey's
fleet, and, if it put to sea, he should desert Sicily. I asked, what
was the meaning of his six lictors, why their staves were laurelled,
if the Senate gave them to him, and why there were six, if Caesar gave
them. [128] He said, "I wanted to snatch a vote from the House for them
(for it could not be done openly): but Caesar hates the Senate like
poison, and declares that all such authority will

[128] Six lictors were the regular number for the propraetor of Sicily;
but their staves would not be laurelled as Curio had not won a victory
over a public enemy. If appointed a _legatus_ to Caesar he might have
had proconsular powers and twelve lictors.

"Cur autem sex?" "Quia XII nolui; nam licebat." Tum ego "Quam vellem,"
inquam, "petisse ab eo, quod audio Philippum impetrasse! Sed veritus
sum, quia ille a me nihil impetrabat." "Libenter," inquit, "tibi
concessisset. Verum puta te impetrasse; ego enim ad eum scribam, ut
tu ipse voles, de ea re nos inter nos locutos. Quid autem illius
interest, quoniam in senatum non venis, ubi sis? Quin nunc ipsum
minime offendisses eius causam, si in Italia non fuisses." Ad quae ego
me recessum et solitudinem quaerere, maxime quod lictores haberem.
Laudavit consilium. "Quid ergo?" inquam; "nam mihi cursus in Graeciam
per tuam provinciam est, quoniam ad mare superum milites sunt." "Quid

exquiram. Iurabat ad summam, quod nullo negotio facere solet,
amicissimum mihi Caesarem esse. "Dubito equidem," inquam. "Scripsit
ad me Dolabella." "Dic, quid?" Adfirmabat eum scripsisse, quod me
cuperet ad urbem venire, illum quidem gratias agere maximas et non modo
probare, sed etiam gaudere. Quid quaeris? acquievi, Levata

proceed from him." "But why six?" "Because I didn't want twelve, though
I could have had them." I said: "I wish I had asked for what I hear
Philippus has got from him: but I was afraid to ask, as he got nothing
from me." He replied: "He would willingly have given you permission.
But take it that you did get it. I will write to him just as you wish,
and say we have spoken about the matter. What does it matter to him
where you are, as you do not attend the House? If you were not in Italy
at this very moment, it would not damage his cause in the least."
I responded that I was looking for a retired and solitary retreat,
especially because I still had my lictors in attendance. He agreed
with me. "How about this then," said I. "My way through to Greece lies
through your province, as the Adriatic is guarded." "There is nothing I
should like better," he said, and added many very handsome remarks. So
something has come of it: I could sail not only in safety, but openly.

The rest he put off for the next day: I will write and tell you if
there is anything worth mentioning. But there are some things I omitted
to ask: whether Caesar was going to wait for an interregnum, or what
he meant by saying that he had been offered the consulship but had
refused it for the next year. And there are other points I must ask
about. Finally he swore--though to be sure he makes no bones about
swearing--that Caesar was very friendly to me. I expressed my doubt. He
said he had heard from Dolabella. I asked what he said, and he declared
he said Caesar had thanked him warmly for wanting me to go to Rome, and
not only approved but showed pleasure. Of course I felt relieved.

The suspicion of domestic treachery and of the talk with Hirtius has
been removed. How I hope young Quintus is worthy of his family, and how
I keep urging myself to note the points in his favour! But need he have
visited Hirtius? There is something in the tale, but I hope it may not
prove of much consequence. Still I wonder he is not back yet. But we
shall see about this.

Please introduce Terentia to the Oppii: for there is only one danger
in Rome now.[130] As for me, give me the benefit of your advice as to
whether I am to go to Regium on foot or to embark straight from here,
and on all the other points too, as I am staying here. I shall have
something to write as soon as I have seen Curio. Please keep me posted
up in news about Tiro's condition, as you have done.

not be too troublesome. The letter I forwarded at once to Vestorius;
he kept asking why it was not sent. Vettienus has spoken with you in
a tone more accommodating than his letter to me: but I am greatly
astonished at the man's carelessness. Philotimus informed me that he
could buy that lodge of Canuleius for 400 guineas, and could get it
even for less, if I asked Vettienus to act as purchaser. So I did ask
Vettienus to get a deduction from that sum, if he could. He promised.
Lately he has informed me that he bought it for about £250, and asked
me to inform him to whom I wished to convey it, adding that the day for
payment was the 13th of November. My reply was somewhat cross, but yet
in a familiar joking vein. Now, as he is acting handsomely, I have no
charge against him, and I have written to him that you have informed
me. Please let me know about your journey, what you intend to do and

So far nothing stops me beyond the weather. I am not going to play a

Yes, I think you are right to hedge, and stay in Apulia and Sipontum:
nor do I consider that your case is the same as mine. Of course in the
matter of the constitution the right course is the same for both of us:
but the constitution is not now in question. It is a struggle between
two kings, in which defeat has overtaken the more moderate king, the
one who is more upright and honest, the one whose failure means that
the very name of the Roman people must be wiped out, though, if he wins
the victory, he will use it after the manner and example of Sulla.
Therefore in a contest like this you must not openly express your
sentiments for either side, but must await the event. My case however
is different. I am under the bond of an obligation, and cannot show
ingratitude. But yet I do not fancy that I shall be found in the line
of battle, but at Malta or some other similar place. You may say I

videbimus; exeamus modo. Quod ut meliore tempore possimus, facit

Curio mecum vixit, iacere Caesarem putans offensione populari
Siciliaeque diffidens, si Pompeius navigare coepisset.

Quintum puerum accepi vehementer. Avaritiam video fuisse et spem magni
congiarii. Magnum hoc malum est, sed scelus illud, quod timueramus,
spero nullum fuisse. Hoc autem vitium puto te existimare non a nostra
indulgentia, sed a natura profectum. Quem tamen nos disciplina regemus.

Et res ipsa monebat, et tu ostenderas, et ego videbam de iis rebus,
quas intercipi periculosum esset, finem inter nos scribendi fieri
tempus esse. Sed, cum ad me saepe mea Tullia scribat orans, ut, quid in
Hispania geratur, exspectem, et semper

do not help the man to whom I am loth to show ingratitude. No. Perhaps
he would have been glad if I had helped him less. But that we shall
see. Let me only get away. A fair opportunity is offered now that
Dolabella is in the Adriatic and Curio in the straits of Sicily.

I have conceived some hope that Servius Sulpicius wishes to see me. I
have dispatched Philotimus, my freedman, to him with a letter. If he
wishes to play the man, we shall have a fine time together. But if not,
well, I shall be my own old self. Curio stayed with me. He thinks that
Caesar is falling in popular esteem and he is mistrustful about going
to Sicily, if Pompey should begin a naval action.

The boy Quintus got it hot when he came. I see it was greed and the
hope of a large bounty. This is a great evil; but disloyalty, which I
feared, there was I hope none. But this flaw, I fancy you will gather,
did not proceed from my spoiling him, but from his own temperament.
Still, I must teach him discipline.

As to the Oppii of Velia, you will arrange with Philotimus as you think
fit. Your place in Epirus I shall regard as my own; but it seems I
shall go on another tack.

Consilium istud tunc esset prudens, ut mihi videtur, si nostras
rationes ad Hispaniensem casum accommodaturi essemus; quod fieri non
debet.[135] Necesse est enim aut, id quod maxime velim, pelli istum
ab Hispania, aut trahi id bellum, aut istum, ut confidere videtur,
apprehendere Hispanias. Si pelletur, quam gratus aut quam honestus tum
erit ad Pompeium noster adventus, cum ipsum Curionem ad eum transiturum
putem? Si trahitur bellum, quid exspectem aut quam diu? Relinquitur,
ut, si vincimur in Hispania, quiescamus. Id ego contra puto. Istum
enim victorem magis relinquendum puto quam victum, et dubitantem
magis quam fidentem suis rebus. Nam caedem video, si vicerit, et
impetum in privatorum pecunias et exsulum reditum et tabulas novas et
turpissimorum honores et regnum non modo Romano homini, sed ne Persae
quidem cuiquam tolerabile. Tacita esse poterit indignitas nostra? pati
poterunt oculi me cum Gabinio sententiam dicere, et quidem illum rogari
prius? praesto esse clientem tuum Clodium, C. Atei Plaguleium, ceteros?
Sed cur inimicos conligo, qui meos necessarios a me defensos nec videre
in curia sine dolore nec versari inter eos sine dedecore potero? Quid,

always adds that you think the same, and this is what I have gathered
myself from your letters, I think it is well for me to write to you
what I think about it.

The advice would be wise, it seems to me, only if I meant to shape my
course according to what happens in Spain. That is impossible. For
either, as I should much prefer, Caesar must be driven from Spain, or
the war will drag on, or Caesar will seize Spain, as he seems to be
confident. If Caesar is driven from Spain, you can imagine how pleasing
and honourable my arrival will seem to Pompey, when I suppose even
Curio will go over to him. If the war drags on, for what am I to wait
or how long? The remaining alternative is that I should keep neutral,
if we are beaten in Spain. I take the opposite view: for I think I am
more bound to desert Caesar as victor than as vanquished, and while
he is still doubtful rather than confident about his fortunes: for I
foresee a massacre, if he conquers, attack on the wealth of private
persons, the recall of exiles, repudiation of debts, high office for
the vilest men, and a tyranny intolerable to a Persian much more to a
Roman. Will my indignation be able to keep silence? Can my eyes endure
to see myself giving my vote along with Gabinius, or indeed Gabinius
being asked his opinion before me? Your client Clodius in waiting?
Plaguleius, the client of C. Ateius, and all the others? But why do I
make a list of opponents, when I shall be unable to see in the House
without pain friends whom I have defended or to mix with them without
shame? And what if even that may not be allowed to me, for all I know?
For Caesar's friends write me that he is not at all

in Hispaniis, nisi forte iis amissis arma Pompeium abiecturum putas,

satisfied because I did not come to the Senate. Am I still to hesitate
whether to sell myself to him at grave risk, when I refused to join
him even with a certainty of reward. Besides consider this that the
verdict on the whole contest does not depend on Spain; unless perhaps
you think that, if Spain is lost, Pompey will throw down his arms, when
his policy has always been that of Themistocles. He considers that the
master of the sea must be master of the empire: so he has never planned
to hold Spain for its own sake. The equipment of the fleet has always
been his first care. So he will take to the sea in due season with a
huge fleet and will come to Italy. What then will be the fate of us, if
we stay here idle? Neutrality will be impossible. Shall we then resist
the fleet? Could there be a crime deeper, greater or baser? Isolated I
ran risks: shall I hesitate with the help of Pompey and the rest of the
nobles. If now I am to take no account of duty but only of danger, it
is from Pompey's party I run risk, if I do wrong, from Caesar, if I do
right: and such is our evil plight that no plan is so free from danger
as to leave a doubt that I should avoid doing with disgrace as well
as danger what I should have avoided, if it had been safe. You will
say I might safely have crossed the sea with Pompey. It was altogether
impossible. It is easy to reckon the days: but nevertheless (for let
me confess the truth: I do not even sugar my confession) supposing I
could, I was mistaken over a point which perhaps ought not to have
misled me; but it did. I thought that peace might be made: and, if it
should be, I did not wish Caesar to be angry with me, when at the same
time he was

ministris? ii provincias, ii rem publicam regent, quorum nemo duo
menses potuit patrimonium suum gubernare?

Non sunt omnia colligenda, quae tu acutissime perspicis, sed tamen ea
pone ante oculos; iam intelleges id regnum vix semenstre esse posse.
Quod si me fefellerit, feram, sicut multi clarissimi homines in re
publica excellentes tulerunt, nisi forti me Sardanapalli vicem [in
suo lectulo][138] mori malle censueris quam exsilio Themistocleo. Qui

friendly with Pompey. For I had realized how exactly they were alike.
That fear of mine led me to delay. But I gain all now by haste, and, if
I delay, I lose all. Nevertheless, my friend, there are auguries which
urge me on, with hope not uncertain: I do not mean those of my own
college which came down from Attus Navius: but Plato's words about the
tyrant.[139] For I see that Caesar can in no way maintain his position
much longer, without causing his own fall, even if we are backward.
For in his first and flourishing days it did not take him a week to
incur the bitter hatred of the needy abandoned rabble, by letting slip
through his fingers so quickly his fictitious claim to two things,
clemency in the case of Metellus and ample wealth in the case of the
public money. Now what kind of associates and servants can he employ?
Are men to rule provinces and direct affairs not one of whom could
steer his own fortunes for two months?

[139] Probably _Republic_ VIII, 562.

I need not put all the points together; you see them clearly enough:
but put them before your eyes and you will understand that his reign
can hardly last for half a year. If I am mistaken, I will bear the
consequences, as many illustrious men, eminent in public life, have
borne them, unless perhaps you consider that I should prefer to die
like Sardanapalus [in his bed] rather than like Themistocles in exile.
For Thucydides tells us that though Themistocles was "the best judge of
current affairs on the shortest reflection, and the shrewdest to guess
at what would happen in the future," yet he fell into misfortunes,
which he would have escaped, had there been no

casus, quos vitasset, si eum nihil fefellisset. Etsi is erat, ut ait
idem, qui τὸ ἄμεινον καὶ τὸ χεῖρον ἐν τῷ ἀφανεῖ ἔτι ἑώρα μάλιστα,
tamen non vidit, nec quo modo Lacedaemoniorum nec quo modo suorum
civium invidiam effugeret nec quid Artaxerxi polliceretur. Non fuisset
illa nox tam acerba Africano, sapientissimo viro, non tam dirus ille
dies Sullanus callidissimo viro, C. Mario, si nihil utrumque eorum
fefellisset. Nos tamen hoc confirmamus illo augurio, quo diximus,
nec nos fallit, nec aliter accidet. Corruat iste necesse est aut
per adversarios aut ipse per se, qui quidem sibi est adversarius
unus acerrimus. Id spero vivis nobis fore; quamquam tempus est nos
de illa perpetua iam, non de hac exigua vita cogitare. Sin quid
accident maturius, haud sane mea multum interfuerit, utrum factum
videam an futurum esse multo ante viderim. Quae cum ita sint, non
est committendum, ut iis paream, quos contra me senatus, ne quid res

Tibi sunt omnia commendata, quae commendationis meae pro tuo in nos

error in his calculations. Though he was, as the same writer says, "a
clear-sighted judge of the better and the worse course in a doubtful
crisis,"[140] yet he failed to see how to avoid the hate of the
Spartans and his own fellow-citizens, nor what promise he ought to make
to Artaxerxes. Africanus would have been spared that cruel night,[141]
and that master of craft C. Marius the fateful day of Sulla's triumph,
if nothing had ever escaped their calculations. So I strengthen myself
by that prophetic remark of Plato: I am not deceived nor will it happen
otherwise. Caesar is bound to fall either through the agency of his
enemies or of himself, and he is his own worst enemy. I hope it will
be in our lifetime, though it is an occasion for us to consider the
lasting future and not our own narrow life. If anything happens to me
before that day, it will not have mattered to me much whether I see it
come about or foresee that it will happen long before. Since this is
so, I must not obey men against whom the Senate armed me with power to
see that the Republic took no harm.[142]

many kindnesses none has given me greater pleasure than your very
gracious and constant care of Tullia. She herself has been charmed and
I not less. She has shown admirable qualities, has borne the national
calamity and private worries with great fortitude and displayed it over
my departure. She loves me and sympathizes with me and yet wishes me to
act rightly and keep my good repute. But enough of this, lest I begin
to pity myself.

If you get more certain tidings about Spain or any other matter, pray
write and tell me while I am here, and perhaps at the time of going I
may send you news, the more so because Tullia fancies that you are not
leaving Italy at the present moment. I must explain to Antony as I did
to Curio that I want to stay in Malta and refuse to take part in this
civil war. I only hope that I may find him as easy and good to me as I
found Curio. He will come it is said to Misenum on the second, that is
to-day; but he has sent in advance a nasty letter of which I subjoin a
copy:

"Had I not a great affection for you, and much more than you think, I
should not have been alarmed at a report which has been spread about
you, especially as I thought it to be false. But, just because I like
you so very much, I cannot hide from myself that the report, although
it may be false, causes me great concern. That you are about to go over

and your daughter Tullia, that queen among women, and you are rated so
highly by all of us, who, I dare swear, care almost more than you do
for your dignity and position. However, I considered that it was no
part of a friend to be unmoved even when scoundrels talked, and I have
been more particular, because I thought that a harder task was laid
upon me by our disagreement, which sprang more from jealousy on my part
than from wrong on yours; for I want you to convince yourself that no
one is dearer to me than you, except Caesar, and at the same time I am
positive that Caesar reckons M. Cicero highly among his friends. So my
dear Cicero I beg you not to commit yourself and not to rely on the
honour of a man, who for the sake of conferring a kindness first did
you a harm, and on the other hand not to flee from a man, who although
he will not love you, which is out of the question, will always wish
you to be safe and in high distinction.

"I have taken the trouble to send you Calpurnius, an intimate friend

On the same day Philotimus brought me a letter from Caesar of which
this is a copy:

"CAESAR IMPERATOR TO CICERO IMPERATOR, GREETING.


"Although I had concluded that you would do nothing rashly or
imprudently, nevertheless I have been so stirred by what people say

goodwill to each other not to go anywhere, now that fortune inclines my

necessary to go before anything was certain. For you will have done a
serious injury to our friendship and consulted your own interest very
little, if you show that you are not following fortune (for everything
that has happened seems most favourable to me and most unfavourable
to Pompey), nor yet following the right cause (for the cause was the
same then, when you thought fit to hold aloof from it), but that you
have condemned some act of mine, the greatest harm you could do me.
Do not take such a step, I pray you by the right of our friendship.
Finally what better befits a good and peaceful man and a loyal citizen
than to keep out of civil disturbance. There are some who approved
such a course, but could not follow it because of the danger. But
you may examine the evidence of my life and the opinion given by my
friendship[144]; you will find no safer or more honourable course than
to keep quite clear of the quarrel.

The arrival of Philotimus (what a fellow he is! how stupid! how often
he lies on Pompey's behalf!) has frightened the rest of us to death.
For myself I am hardened. None of us doubted that Caesar had checked
Pompey's progress: Philotimus says he is simply flying. Nobody doubted
that Petreius had joined Afranius: he brings no such news. In fact we
have all been sure that Pompey had actually made

contentione abesse. Dices: "Ubi ille ergo tuus animus, quem proximis

Lacrimae meorum me interdum molliunt precantium ut de Hispaniis

his way with large forces into Germany through Illyricum, for that was
the news _sans doute_. So I think I must make for Malta, until there
is news from Spain. This from Caesar's letter I almost think I may do
without annoying him, for he says there is no more honourable or safe
course open to me than to keep quite clear of the fight. You will say
"Where then is your courage which you showed in recent letters?" It is
there and the same; but would that I had only to decide for myself. The
tears of my family at times weaken me, when they beg me to wait for
news about Spain. The miserable tone of M. Caelius' letter making this
same request that I should wait, not to risk so rashly my fortunes, my
only son and all my family, moved our boys to weeping; although my own
son is made of stronger stuff, and for that very reason he affects me
more deeply, thinking only of my reputation.

So I shall go to Malta, thence where it seems good. Still even now send
me a line, especially if there is any news from Afranius. If I have an
interview with Antony, I will inform you of the result. However, as you
advise, I will take care how I trust him, for the policy of concealment
is hard and dangerous too. Servius Sulpicius I await till the 7th. Both
his wife Postumia and his son urge me to this. I rejoice that your ague
is better. I send you also a copy of Caelius' letter.

praedixisse neque temere monuisse, sed, postquam Caesarem convenerim

reliquae tibi carae sunt, si aliquid apud te nos, si vir optimus,
gener tuus, valemus, quorum fortunam non debes velle conturbare, noli
committere,[145] ut eam causam, in cuius victoria salus nostra est,
odisse aut relinquere cogamur, aut impiam cupiditatem contra salutem
tuam habeamus. Denique illud cogita, quod offensae fuerit in ista
cunctatione, te subisse. Nunc te contra victorem Caesarem facere,
quem dubiis rebus laedere noluisti, et ad eos fugatos accedere, quos
resistentes sequi nolueris, summae stultitiae est. Vide, ne, dum
pudet te parum optimatem esse, parum diligenter, quid optimum sit,
eligas. Quod si totum tibi persuadere non possum, saltem, dum, quid de
Hispaniis agamus, scitur,

without saying exactly what it is, though you disclose sufficiently
what kind of an act it is, I write this on the spot. In the name of
your fortunes and your children, I beg and beseech you, Cicero, not to
take any step that may endanger your life and safety. For I call gods
and men and our friendship to witness that I told you before, and that
it was no casual warning that I gave you, but certain information,
after I had met Caesar and found out what his view would be, if he won
the victory. If you imagine that he will maintain his present policy of
letting his adversaries go and making peace, you are mistaken; he is
meditating and even proclaiming nothing but cruelty and severity. He
left Rome in anger with the Senate: these recent vetoes have clearly
provoked him: you may take my word for it there will be no chance
of begging off. Then, if you have any care for yourself, your only
son, your house and what hopes you have left, if I and your excellent
son-in-law have any influence with you--and you ought not to wish to
spoil our fortunes--then do not compel us to hate or relinquish a
cause, in whose victory our safety lies, or to harbour unnatural wishes
for your destruction. Finally consider this: any offence there may
have been in your hesitation, you have already given. Now it is the
height of folly to side against Caesar in his hour of victory, when you
refused to attack him while his fortunes were doubtful; and to join in
the flight of those, whom you would not follow when they stood their
ground. Beware lest for fear of showing too little zeal for the "better
party," you use too little care in choosing the better course. But, if
I cannot persuade you entirely, at least wait till it is known how we
get on in Spain,

exspecta; quas tibi nuntio adventu Caesaris fore nostras. Quam isti
spem habeant amissis Hispaniis, nescio; quod porro tuum consilium sit
ad desperatos accedere, non medius fidius reperio.

Hoc, quod tu non dicendo mihi significasti, Caesar audierat, ac, simul
atque "have" mihi dixit, statim, quid de te audisset, exposuit. Negavi
me scire, sed tamen ab eo petivi, ut ad te litteras mitteret, quibus
maxime ad remanendum commoveri posses. Me secum in Hispaniam ducit.
Nam, nisi ita faceret, ego, priusquam ad urbem accederem, ubicumque
esses, ad te percucurrissem, et hoc a te praesens contendissem atque
omni vi te retinuissem. Etiam atque etiam, Cicero, cogita, ne te
tuosque omnis funditus evertas, ne te sciens prudensque eo demittas,
unde exitum vides nullum esse. Quodsi te aut voces optimatium
commovent, aut non nullorum hominum insolentiam et iactationem
ferre non potes, eligas censeo aliquod oppidum vacuum a bello, dum
haec decernuntur; quae iam erunt confecta. Id si feceris, et ego te
sapienter fecisse iudicabo, et Caesarem non offendes.

which I assure you will be ours as soon as Caesar arrives. What your
friends' hopes are, when they have lost Spain, is more than I know; and
what your idea is in joining them, when they have no hopes, is more
than I can imagine.

What you hinted at without speaking plainly, Caesar had heard, and
as soon as ever he had said "good day," he told me what he had heard
about you. I said I knew nothing about it: but I asked him to send you
a letter as the best means of inducing you to stay. He is taking me
with him to Spain. If he were not, I should have hurried to you, before
going to Rome, wherever you might have been, and should have pressed
this view on you personally and done all in my power to restrain you.
Once more and yet once more, Cicero, think before you utterly destroy
yourself and all your family: do not wittingly and with your eyes open
put yourself in a position from which you see there is no escape. But,
if you are moved by the call of the conservative party, or if you
cannot endure the insolence and arrogant behaviour of certain persons,
I think you should choose some town remote from the war, until the
matter is settled: and settled it will be at once. If you do that, I
shall consider you have acted wisely, and Caesar will not be offended.

How blind I am not to have foreseen it! I send you Antony's letter.
I have often written to him that I planned nothing against Caesar's

invitus cursarem, abesse velle, nec id ipsum certum etiam nunc habere,
vide, quam ad haec παραινετικῶς:

"Tuum consilium quam verum est. Nam, qui se medium esse vult, in
patria manet, qui proficiscitur, aliquid de altera utra parte
iudicare videtur. Sed ego is non sum, qui statuere debeam, iure quis

discedere ex Italia paterer. Quare parvi refert me probare cogitationem

that, if I had thought otherwise, I could have been with Pompey, that
I wished to leave Italy because I was loth to wander about with my
lictors, though I had not made up my mind definitely even to that. See
in what an _ex cathedra_ tone he answers me:--"Your policy is quite
right. For a man who wishes to be neutral remains in his country; the
man who leaves his country seems to express his conviction on one side
or the other; but it is not for me to determine, whether anyone has
the right to leave or not. The part Caesar has given me is not to let
anyone at all leave Italy; so it is of little use for me to approve
your plan, if all the same I cannot make an exception for you. I think
you should send to Caesar and ask him this favour. I have no doubt
that you will succeed, especially as you promise not to forget our
friendship."

That is a laconic epistle.[146] I will certainly take my cue from the
man. He is to come on the evening of the 3rd, that is to-day. To-morrow
therefore he will perhaps come to me. I will sound him: I will hear
him: say I am in no hurry: that I will send to Caesar. I will act
secretly, with a very few attendants I will lie hidden somewhere; but
assuredly, however unwilling these people are, I will fly off; and
would that it may be to Curio! "Mark what I say."[147] Another great
grief has come upon me. I will do something worthy of my reputation.

Massilians[148] pleased me. Let me know whatever you hear. I should
have liked to have Ocella, if it could be done openly, and I had got
Curio to allow it. Here I am awaiting Servius Sulpicius, for it is at
the request of his wife and son, and I think it is necessary. Antony
carries about Cytheris[149] with him in an open litter as his second
wife, and besides he had seven other litters of friends male or female.
See what a disgraceful death we die, and doubt, if you can, that,
whether Caesar returns victor or vanquished, he will perpetrate a
massacre. Even in an open boat, if I cannot get a vessel, I will tear
myself away from these parricides and their doings. But I will write

a letter from you. The conduct of my brother about which you write
shows little firmness, but no chicanery, no treachery, nothing
inflexibly opposed to goodness, nothing that cannot be turned where you
will by a single conversation. In short all his relations, even those
with whom he is so often angry, are nevertheless dear to him, and I
to be sure am dearer than life. I do not blame him for writing in one
strain about his boy to you and in another to the boy's mother. I am
distressed by what you say about the journey and your sister, and the
more so because the times are such that I cannot remedy the matter. For
certainly I would have done so: but you see in what trouble I am, what
desperation.

As for his financial affairs, I often hear from him, and they are
not in such a state as to prevent him from being anxious to pay you
and from making efforts to that end: but if Q. Axius does not pay me
in this my flight the £100 I lent his son, and pleads in excuse the
state of the times, and if Lepta and others do the same, I confess I
am always surprised to hear from Quintus that he is pressed for some
£175. For of course you see his straits. However he has ordered the
sum to be paid to your account. Perhaps you suppose that he is slow or
close-fisted in money matters. No one is less so: but enough about my
brother.

As for his son, the father has certainly always indulged him; but
indulgence does not make him a liar or a miser or disloyal to his
friends, though it does perhaps make him surly, haughty and aggressive.
Accordingly he has these defects which are due to spoiling; but they
are not intolerable, shall I say, as young men go nowadays. But the
defects which, to

quae mihi quidem, qui illum amo, sunt his ipsis malis, in quis sumus,
miseriora, non sunt ab obsequio nostro. Nam suas radices habent;
quas tamen evellerem profecto, si liceret. Sed ea tempora sunt, ut
omnia mihi sint patienda. Ego meum facile teneo; nihil est enim eo
tractabilius. Cuius quidem misericordia languidiora adhuc consilia
cepi, et, quo ille me certiorem vult esse, eo magis timeo, ne in eum
exsistam crudelior.

Sed Antonius venit heri vesperi. Iam fortasse ad me veniet, aut ne id
quidem, quoniam scripsit, quid fieri vellet. Sed scies continuo, quid
actum sit. Nos iam nihil nisi occulte.

De pueris quid agam? parvone navigio committam? Quid mihi animi in
navigando censes fore? Recordor enim, aestate cum illis illo Rhodiorum
ἀφράκτῳ navigans quam fuerim sollicitus; quid duro tempore anni
actuariola fore censes? O rem undique miseram!

Trebatius erat mecum, vir plane et civis bonus. Quae ille monstra, di
immortales! Etiamne Balbus in senatum venire cogitet? Sed ei ipsi cras
ad te litteras dabo. Vettienum mihi amicum, ut scribis, ita puto esse.

me at any rate who love him, are more distressing than even the evils
on which we have fallen, do not proceed from any indulgence of mine;
for they are deep rooted: but I would have rooted them up, had I
been allowed. But the times are such that I must bear everything. My
own son I control easily. He is quite tractable. My own policy has
lacked vigour owing to my pity for him; and the more he wants me to be
unflinching, the more I fear I may prove cruel to him.

Well Antony came yesterday evening; soon perhaps he will visit me,
perhaps not even that, as he has written what he wanted done; but you
shall know forthwith what has happened. All I do now is done secretly.

What shall I do about the boys? Shall I entrust them to a small boat?
What courage do you suppose I shall have on the voyage? For I remember
sailing in the summer in an open Rhodian boat with them and how anxious
I was; and how do you suppose it will be in the bad season in a tiny
pinnace? Misery everywhere!

Trebatius is with me, a real man and a loyal citizen. Ye gods, what
awful news he brings! So even Balbus is thinking of attending the
Senate! But I will give Trebatius himself a letter for you to-morrow. I
agree with your letter that Vettienus is friendly to me. But I made a
rather bitter jest at his expense, because he wrote curtly to me about
paying my debt. Appease him, if he took it in bad part. I addressed
him by his title "commissioner of the mint" because he addressed me as
"proconsul." But since he is a good man and has affection for me, let
me keep my affection for him. Farewell.

Quidnam mihi futurum est, aut quis me non solum infelicior, sed iam

What is to happen to me? Who is there more ill-starred, or even more
humiliated? Antony says he has received orders about me definitely. Yet
I have not seen him myself so far; but he told Trebatius. What can I
do now? Nothing succeeds and all my best laid plans fail abominably.
For, when I had won over Curio, I imagined I had attained my end. He
had written about me to Hortensius. Reginus was wholly my friend. I
never suspected that Antony had anything to do with this part of the
sea. Whither can I turn now? Everywhere I am watched. But enough of
lamentation. I must steal away and creep privily into some cargo boat;
I must not allow it to appear that I connive at being hindered. I must
go to Sicily. If I once get there, I shall have greater ends in view.
If only all goes well in Spain! However, I do hope the news about
Sicily may prove true! Hitherto I have had no luck. It is said the
Sicilians have gathered round Cato, prayed him to resist and promised
every support: and that he has been induced to begin making a levy. I
don't believe it, good as the authority is. I know for a fact that that
province could have been held. But we shall soon hear from Spain.

Here I have C. Marcellus, who holds the same views as myself or makes a
good pretence of doing so. I have not indeed met him myself; but I hear
it from one of his most intimate friends. Write to me, if you have any
news. If I attempt anything, I shall inform you at once. Young Quintus

Undoubtedly I must admit I have been mistaken. But is it once only or
on one topic? No, in everything. The more carefully I have thought, the
less wisely have I done. "Let bygones be bygones."[152] In the future
only let us not invite disaster. You bid me provide for my journey.
What can I provide? All the possible accidents are so obvious, that,
if I would shun them, I must sit still in shame and grief: and, if I
disregard them, it is odds that I fall into the hands of villains. But
see how miserable I am. Sometimes it seems preferable that I should
receive some damage however bitter from Caesar's party, that people
may see I am hated by the tyrant. But, if the voyage for which I hoped
were open to me, certainly, as you wish and advise, I should have done
something to justify delay. But I am watched with extraordinary care
and even Curio is suspect. So I must make a bold move or use craft. If
a bold move, I need good weather: but, if craft, should there be any
_faux pas_, you see how disgraced I should be. I am carried away by
circumstances and must not be afraid of a bold course.

De Caelio saepe mecum agito nec, si quid habuero tale, dimittam.
Hispanias spero firmas esse. Massiliensium factum cum ipsum per se
luculentum est, tum mihi argumento est recte esse in Hispaniis. Minus
enim auderent, si aliter esset, et scirent; nam et vicini et diligentes
sunt. Odium autem recte animadvertis significatum in theatro. Legiones
etiam has, quas in Italia assumpsit, alienissimas esse video. Sed
tamen nihil inimicius quam sibi ipse. Illud recte times, ne ruat. Si
desperarit, certe ruet. Quo magis efficiendum aliquid est, fortuna

I often reflect about Caelius; and if I have such an opportunity, I
will not let it go. I hope Spain is safe. The action of the Massilians
is praiseworthy in itself, and is a proof to me that things are going
well in Spain. They would have been less bold, if it were otherwise,
and they should know, for they live near and are watchful. You are
right to remark the expression of popular feeling in the theatre. Even
the legions which Caesar got in Italy seem to me to be very disloyal
to him. However he is his own worst enemy. You are right to fear that
he may run amuck. Assuredly he will, if he loses hope. That is all the
more inducement for me to do something in the spirit of Caelius, and
I hope with better luck. But everything in due course; and, whatever
it be, I will inform you forthwith. I will do all for young Quintus
that is necessary, and will undertake the task not only of Arcadia but
of the whole Peloponnese.[154] He is able, if only he had character.
However, if he has none so far, he may get it, or virtue is not
teachable, and that I can never believe.

how he plays the statesman. He summoned by letter ten leading men and
the board of four from the municipal towns. They came to his country
house in the morning. First he slept till nine. Then, when he heard the
men had come from Naples and Cumae (for Caesar is angry with them),
he bade them return on the next day, saying that he wished to take a
bath and a laxative. This he did yesterday. But to-day he has arranged
to cross to Aenaria. He is promising the exiles[157] that they shall
return.

Vestorius. Servius is said to have stopped at Menturnae on the 6th of
May. To-day he will stop with C. Marcellus in his villa at Liternum.
To-morrow early he will see me, and will give me a subject for a letter
to you. Just now I can find nothing to write. I am much astonished that
Antony has not even sent a messenger to me, especially when he has paid
me much attention. I suppose he has some more truculent order about me.
He does not wish to refuse me to my face, but I was not going to ask
the favour, nor, if I had got it, should I have believed him. However
I will think out some plan. Let me know if anything has happened in
Spain; for now there is time for news to have come, and everybody
awaits it with the idea, that, if all go well there, there will be no
more trouble. But I do not think the business is over, if Spain be
kept, nor yet hopeless, if it be lost. Silius and Ocella and the rest
I suppose are detained. I see that you too are hindered by Curtius,
though I think you have a passport.

What a wretched life this is! and to be so long afraid is more wretched
than the very thing one fears! Servius, as I told you before, came
on the 7th of May and on the next morning visited me. Not to detain
you longer, we could not see our way to a plan. Never have I seen a
man more upset with fear; and upon my soul he feared nothing that did
not deserve to be feared. He pointed out that Pompey was angry with
him, that Caesar was not friendly, that the victory of either would
be terrible, both because Pompey was cruel and Caesar daring, and
because of their money difficulties, which could only be got rid of by
an attack on private property. He bewailed all this with such a flood
of tears, that I was surprised they had not dried up in all that long
time of misery. My own eyes do not shed one single tear, though this
inflammation prevents me from writing to you; but it is often tiresome
by keeping me awake. So please collect all the consolation you can and
send it to me--not from philosophy or books--I have plenty of that, but
I find somehow that the cure is too weak for the disease. Search rather
for any news about Spain or Massilia. What Servius says about them is
quite satisfactory, and he also tells me there is excellent authority
for the story of the two legions. News of this kind then send me, if
you get it, and such like topics. Anyhow in a few days something must
be heard.

But to return to Servius. We deferred all our conversation to the next
day: but he is reluctant to leave Italy, declaring he would much rather
die in

Adhuc non satis faciebat; debet autem mihi multos nummos nec habetur
locuples. Nunc ait se daturum; cui expensum tulerit, morari;
tabellariis, si apud te esset qua satis fecisset, dares. Quantum sit,
Eros Philotimi tibi dicet. Sed ad maiora redeamus.

Quod optas, Caelianum illud maturescit. Itaque torqueor, utrum ventum

his bed whatever happens. He has unpleasant scruples about his son's
military service at Brundisium. On one point he is quite firm, that,
if the condemned are restored, he will go into exile. I for my part
replied "that will certainly happen, and what is happening is equally
disagreeable," and I quoted many examples. My examples however did not
increase his courage but his fear: so that it appears I must rather
conceal from him my design than invite him to share it. He is not to be
depended on. By your advice I will consider about Caelius.

While Servius was with me, Cephalio came with your letter of the 10th,
which gave me great hope of better news about the eight cohorts. For
even the cohorts which are here are said to be wavering. On the same
day Funisulanus brought me a letter from you, corroborating the same
news. I gave him a full reply about his business, explaining all your
kindness. Hitherto he has not been satisfactory; and he owes me a large
sum and is not considered safe. Now he says that he will settle; but
that a debtor of his was slow in paying, and that you are to pay the
money by your letter-carriers, if that debtor has deposited it with
you. The amount Philotimus' man Eros will tell you. But to return to
more important matters.

That Caelian plan you favour is coming to a head: so I am worried
whether to await a favourable wind. It is a standard we want, and men
will flock to it. With your advice, that I should set sail openly, I
entirely agree: and so I think I will set out. However

interim litteras exspecto. Servi consilio nihil, expeditur. Omnes
captiones in omni sententia occurrunt. Unum C. Marcellum cognovi
timidiorem; quem consulem fuisse paenitet. Ὢ πολλῆς ἀγεννείας! qui
etiam Antonium confirmasse dicitur, ut me impediret, quo ipse, credo,
honestius. Antonius autem VI Idus Capuam profectus est. Ad me misit, se
pudore deterritum ad me non venisse, quod me sibi suscensere putaret.
Ibitur igitur et ita quidem, ut censes, nisi cuius gravioris personae
suscipiendae spes erit ante oblata. Sed vix erit tam cito. Allienus
autem praetor putabat aliquem, si ego non, ex collegis suis. Quivis
licet, dum modo aliquis.

De sorore laudo. De Quinto puero datur opera; spero esse meliora. De
Quinto fratre scito eum non mediocriter laborare de versura, sed adhuc
nihil a L. Egnatio expressit. Axius de duodecim milibus pudens! Saepe
enim ad me scripsit, ut Gallio, quantum is vellet, darem. Quodsi non
scripsisset, possemne aliter? Et quidem saepe sum pollicitus, sed
tantum voluit cito. Me vero adiuvarent his in angustiis. Sed di istos!
Verum alias. Te a quartana liberatum gaudeo itemque Piliam. Ego, dum
panis et cetera in navem parantur, excurro in Pompeianum. Vettieno
velim gratias, quod studiosus sit; si quemquam nanctus eris, qui
perferat, litteras des, antequam discedimus.

I await a letter from you meanwhile. Servius' advice has not been
helpful. All sorts of bars meet us in every opinion he expresses. Only
one man, C. Marcellus, have I known to be more timid, and he is sorry
he was ever a consul. What a lowborn spirit! He is said even to have
strengthened Antony's resolution to prevent my departure: so that his
own conduct I suppose may appear more honourable. Antony started for
Capua on the 10th, sending word that shame prevented his visiting me,
because he thought I was annoyed with him. So I shall go, and openly as
you advise, unless hope of playing a more important part shall offer.
But that can scarcely occur so soon. Allienus the praetor thought one
of his colleagues would be chosen,[158] if I were not. Let it be anyone
they like so long as it is some one.

[158] As peace delegate.

As to your sister, I approve. As for young Quintus, I am doing my best,
and I hope things are better. As for my brother Quintus, you must know
that he is taking extraordinary pains to borrow money to settle his
debt; but so far has squeezed nothing out of L. Egnatius. Axius is
modest about the £100[159]: for he often requested in his letters that
I should pay Gallius as much as he wanted. Even if he had not written,
could I have helped it? I have often promised indeed; but he wanted so
much at once. They should have helped me rather in my difficulties,
confound them. But I will write of this another time. I am glad you
are rid of your ague, and Pilia too. While bread and provisions are
being put on board, I am going off to my estate at Pompeii. Please
thank Vettienus for his trouble. If you can find a messenger, give me a
letter before I leave.

I had just sent a letter to you about a number of matters, when very
early in the morning Dionysius came to my house. I should not only
have been civil to him, I should have pardoned him altogether, if he
had come in the spirit you described. For the letter I got at Arpinum
said that he was coming and would do whatever I wanted; and I wanted or
rather longed that he should be with me. It was because he had flatly
refused to do so, when he came to my villa at Formiae, I used to write
to you about him rather bitterly. However, after the first greeting,
he said, to put it shortly, that I must excuse him and that business
prevented his going with me. I said little in reply, but I was greatly
hurt, for I understood that he looked down on my fortunes. You may be
astonished, but you must know that this is one of the greatest sorrows
I have suffered in this crisis. I hope that he may be a friend to you.
When I wish that, I wish you prosperity, for just so long he will be
your friend.

My plan, I hope, will be free from risk, for I have kept the matter a
secret, and, as I think, I shall not be watched very keenly. Only let
the voyage be as good as I want, and all precautions that foresight can
suggest will be taken. While I am here, please write not only anything
you know or hear, but even what you foresee.

Cato, who could have held Sicily without any trouble--and, if he had
held it, all loyalists would have flocked to him--sailed from Syracuse
on the

Curio scripsit. Utinam, quod aiunt, Cotta Sardiniam teneat! est enim
rumor. O, si id fuerit, turpem Catonem!

Ego, ut minuerem suspicionem profectionis aut cogitationis meae,
profectus sum in Pompeianum a. d. IIII Idus, ut ibi essem, dum,
quae ad navigandum opus essent, pararentur. Cum ad villam venissem,
relatum[160] est ad me centuriones trium cohortium, quae Pompeiis sunt,
me velle postridie convenire. Haec mecum Ninnius noster, velle eos mihi
se et oppidum tradere. At ego abii postridie a villa ante lucem, ut me
omnino illi ne viderent. Quid enim erat in tribus cohortibus? quid,
si plures? quo apparatu? Cogitavi eadem illa Caeliana, quae legi in
epistula tua, quam accepi, simul et in Cumanum veni eodem die, et simul
fieri poterat, ut temptaremur. Omnem igitur suspicionem sustuli. Sed,
dum redeo, Hortensius venerat et ad Terentiam salutatum deverterat.
Sermone erat usus honorifico erga me. Iam eum, ut puto, videbo; misit
enim puerum se ad me venire. Hoc quidem melius quam collega noster
Antonius, cuius inter lictores lectica mima portatur.

23rd of April, as Curio has informed me by letter. I only hope Cotta
may hold Sardinia, as they say, for there is a rumour to that effect.
If that happens, what a reflection of Cato!

To lessen suspicion of my journey and intentions I started for my
place at Pompeii on the 12th of May to stay there while the necessary
provisions were made for my voyage. When I arrived, I was told the
centurions of the three cohorts here wished to visit me the next day.
That was what my friend Ninnius said--that they wished to hand over
themselves and the town to me. But I left the next morning before
daybreak, so that they should not see me at all: for what was the
use of three cohorts, or more indeed? And what was our equipment?
I pondered too over the matter of Caelius when I read it in your
letter, which I received on the same day as I arrived at Cumae. It was
possible too that it was a mere ruse, so I did away with all grounds
of suspicion. But, while I was on my way back, Hortensius came, and
turned out of his way to greet Terentia, and he had spoken of me with
much courtesy. I think I shall see him soon, for he has sent a servant
to announce his coming. This is better behaviour than that of my fellow
augur Antony, who carries an actress in a sedan among his lictors.

As you have lost your quartan fever and have not only thrown off your
new malady but also your cold, you must present yourself before me
sound and fit in Greece. Meanwhile drop me a line.

On the 14th of May Hortensius came to me, just as I had written my
letter. I wish his conduct were always as it is now.[163] You would
never believe how gushing he was, and I intend to take advantage of it.
Then Serapion came with a letter from you. Before I opened it, I told
him that you had written to me about him before, as you had done. Then
when I had read the letter, I told him the rest in full detail, and
upon my word I like the man; for I think him to be learned and upright.
Moreover I think I will use his ship and make him my fellow-passenger.

[163] Or "I wish he would always confine himself to writing." But the
passage may be corrupt.

Inflammation of the eyes often breaks out again, not indeed very
troublesome, but enough to prevent my writing. That your health has
recovered from your old complaint and your new attacks I am glad.

I wish I had Ocella here: for it looks as if things are going to be
rather easier. Just now the equinox is delaying me. It has been very
boisterous. When that is over, I only hope Hortensius may keep to the
same mind. So far he could not be more generous.

You wonder about the passport I mentioned, as if I hinted you were
guilty of some crime. You say you can't discover how it came into my
mind. For my part since you wrote that you meditated leaving, and I had
heard that a passport was indispensable, I decided you must have one:
and also because you had taken out a passport for the boys. That was
the reason for my opinion, but please write and tell me

My daughter was confined on the 19th of May: a boy, a seven months'
child. I am glad she had a safe delivery. As for the thing that has
been born, it is a very poor specimen. So far I have been detained by
an astonishing calm, which has been a greater hindrance than the watch
kept on me. For all that gush of Hortensius proved child's talk. So it
will be found. The villain has been corrupted by Salvius his freeman.
Accordingly hereafter I shall write to you, not what I intend to do but
what I have done. For every eavesdropper[164] seems to be listening to
what I say.

[164] The people of Corycus in Pamphylia spied on merchant vessels and
betrayed them to pirates. Hence their name became a proverbial term for
spies and eavesdroppers.

However if you have any news about Spain or any other topic, please
write, but do not count on a letter from me, till I have reached
the desired haven; or possibly I may write something on the voyage.
But even this much I write in fear. How sluggishly and draggingly
everything has gone! The foundation was badly laid and the rest is of a
piece.

Just now I am going to Formiae; perhaps there too the Furies will
follow me. However according to Balbus' conversation with you my idea
of going to Malta does not win approval. Can you doubt then that Caesar
regards me as an enemy? To be sure I have written to Balbus telling him
that you had informed me of his kindness and his suspicion. I

I got your sealed document, which Anteros brought. It gave me no
information about my private affairs. I am exceedingly distressed
about them, because Philotimus, who managed them, is not at Rome, nor
do I know where in the world he is. And my whole hope of preserving
my credit and private property lies in your tried and proved kindness
towards me. If in this last desperate crisis you still show that, I
shall face the dangers which I share with others more courageously:
and I adjure and beseech you to do so. I have in local currency[165]
in Asia nearly £18,000.[166] By a bill of exchange for that amount it
will be easy for you to maintain my credit. Unless I had thought I were
leaving it all square (trusting one, whom you have long since known I
ought not to have trusted), I should have delayed a little longer and
not left my private concerns embarrassed. The reason why I have been
rather long in writing to you about it, is that I was a long time in
gathering what was to be feared. Again and again I beseech you that you
undertake to protect me in every way, so that, supposing my present
associates are spared, I may along with them remain unembarrassed and
put down my safety to your kindness.

[Sidenote: _Epirus, March_, B.C. _48_]

I received your letter on the 4th of February, and on the same day I
accepted the inheritance formally according to the will. Of my many and
miserable anxieties one is taken away, if, as you say, this inheritance
is sufficient to maintain my credit and reputation, though I know you
would have defended it even without the inheritance with all your
resources. As for what you write about the dowry[167] I adjure you for
heaven's sake to manage the whole business and protect the poor girl,
a victim of my culpable carelessness, with my funds, if there are any,
and out of your own, so far as you can without inconvenience. Pray do
not let her remain in the utter want you depict. On what are the rents
of my farms being wasted? That 500 guineas[168] of which you write, no
one ever told me that it had been kept back out of the dowry, for I
would never have allowed it. But that is the least of the blows I have
suffered. I cannot write to you about them for sorrow and tears. Of the
money I had in Asia I have called in nearly half. It would appear to be
safer where it is than with the tax-collectors.

July; cf. xi, 3. Dowries were paid in three instalments.

As for your exhortations to be of good courage, I wish you could find
some reason why I should be so. If, on the top of my other sorrows,
there comes that which Chrysippus said is under consideration (you gave
me no hint), I mean the confiscation of my town

me. I can write no more. You see, I am sure, with what a weight of
misery I am oppressed. If I shared it with others, who seem to be
in the same predicament, I should feel less blameworthy and bear it
better. Now I have no consolation unless you can arrange, if it is now
possible, that I may not be visited with any special disaster and harm.

I have been rather slow in sending back your letter-carrier, because
there was no opportunity of sending him. From your agents I have
received some £600[169] and the necessary clothing. Please send letters
to any people you think right in my name. You know my intimate friends.

What is happening here you may gather from the bearer of your letter.
I have kept him longer than I should, because every day I am expecting
something fresh to happen, and there was no reason for sending him even
now, except the subject on which you ask for an answer, namely what
I wish as to the first of July. Both courses are dangerous, both the
risk of such a sum of money at such a dangerous time, and the breaking
with Dolabella, which you mention, while the political issue is still
uncertain. Accordingly I will leave this matter in particular like
others

to your kind care, and to the consideration and desire of poor Tullia,
whose interests would have been better consulted, if originally I had
discussed our safety and fortunes with you in person rather than by
letter.

You say there is no trouble threatening me especially in this public
misfortune. There is a little consolation in that, but there are many
circumstances special to me, which you must see are very serious and
might easily have been avoided. However they will be less serious, if,
as hitherto, they are lightened by your care and management.

The money is with Egnatius. Let it remain there, so far as I am
concerned: for things cannot last long as they are, so that I shall
soon know what is most necessary. However, I am in want of everything,
because the man I am with[170] too is in great straits and I have lent
him a large sum of money, thinking that, when things settle down, that
will bring me honour as well as profit. Please, as before, if there
are any persons to whom you think I ought to write, do it for me. Pay
my greetings to your family. Take care of your health. Above all, as
you say, make every careful provision that nothing maybe wanting to my
daughter, on whose account you know I am very unhappy.

You ask what new moves have been made. Isidorus will tell you. I don't
think the rest of the task will be any more difficult. Please pay
attention to what you know is my greatest wish, as you say you are
doing. I am overwhelmed by care, and that brings with it also great
bodily infirmity. When that has passed, I shall go to the man who
is conducting the business and who is in high hopes.[171] Brutus is

What were the reasons, how bitter, how grave and unforeseen, which
swayed me and compelled me to act by a kind of impulse rather than
by reflection, I cannot bring myself to write without great agony of
mind. So weighty were they that they have brought about what you see.
Accordingly I do not know what to tell you about my affairs nor what
to ask of you. You can see for yourself the sum and substance of the
matter.

For my part I have gathered from your letters--both that which you
wrote in conjunction with others and the one you wrote in your own
name--what I saw myself too, that you are somewhat disconcerted by
my sudden move, and are looking for some new means of protecting
me. I don't quite see how I can do as you suggest and come nearer
to Rome, travelling through towns at night. For I have not suitable
stopping-places to spend all the days in; nor, for the point you are
aiming at, does it much matter whether I am seen in towns or on the
road. However I will consider how this plan, as well as others, can
most conveniently be carried out.

I am so fearfully upset both in mind and body that I have not been able
to write many letters; I have only answered those who have written to
me. I should like you to write in my name to Basilus and to anyone else
you like, even to Servilius, and say whatever you think fit. From this
letter you will quite understand that the reason why I have not written
to you at all for such a long time, is that I

Sollicitum esse te, cum de tuis communibusque fortunis, tum maxime
de me ac de dolore meo sentio. Qui quidem meus dolor non modo non
minuitur, cum socium sibi adiungit dolorem tuum, sed etiam augetur.
Omnino pro tua prudentia sentis, qua consolatione levari maxime
possim. Probas enim meum consilium negasque mihi quicquam tali tempore
potius faciendum fuisse. Addis etiam (quod etsi mihi levius est quam
tuum iudicium, tamen non est leve) ceteris quoque, id est qui pondus
habeant, factum nostrum probari. Id si ita putarem, levius dolerem.
"Crede," inquis, "mihi." Credo equidem, sed scio, quam cupias minui
dolorem meum. Me discessisse ab armis numquam paenituit. Tanta erat
in illis crudelitas, tanta cum barbaris gentibus coniunctio, ut non

had nothing to write about, not that I did not wish to write.

For your query about Vatinius, neither he nor anyone else would fail
in service to me, if they could find any means of helping me. Quintus

from Corcyra: and I suppose they have set out from there with the
others.

I see you are anxious about your own fate and the fate of us all, and
especially about me and my sorrows; but my sorrows are not lessened one
whit by the addition of yours in sympathy, they are even increased.
Of course your own intelligence makes you feel what consolation can
comfort me most: for you approve of my plan and say that under the
circumstances I could not have done anything better. You add something,
which does not weigh with me so much as your judgement, though it
has some weight, that every one else--I mean every one else who
matters--approves of what I did. If I could persuade myself of that, I
should feel less sorrow. "Believe me," you say. I do believe you; but I
know how anxious you are to relieve my sorrow. I have never regretted
leaving the camp. Cruelty was so rampant there, and there was so close
an alliance with barbarian nations, that a plan was sketched out for
a proscription not of persons but of whole classes; and everybody had
made up their minds that the property of you all was to be the prize of
his victory. I say "you" advisedly, for none

but the cruellest thoughts were entertained about you personally. So
I shall never regret my resolve; but I do regret my plan of action.
I wish I had settled down in some town, till I was called for. There
would have been less talk about me, less pain for me; this particular
regret at any rate would not be worrying me. To remain inactive at
Brundisium is annoying from every point of view. And how can I go
nearer to Rome, as you advise, without the lictors given me by the
people? They cannot be taken from me without depriving me of my rights.
Only lately, as I was approaching Brundisium, I made them mix with the
crowd with nothing but sticks in their hands for fear the soldiery
might attack them: ever since I have kept at home. I have written to
Oppius and to Balbus, asking them to consider how I can move nearer
to Rome. I think they will advise me to do so. For they promise that
Caesar will be anxious not only to preserve my dignity, but even to
increase it; and they bid me be of good cheer and entertain the highest
of hopes. This they warrant and guarantee. Personally I should have
felt surer about it, if I had stayed where I was. But that is harping
on the past; so pray look to the future and investigate the matter
with them, and, if you think it necessary and they approve, call in
Trebonius, Pansa and anyone else you like, that I may win Caesar's
approval by appearing to follow his friends' advice, and let them write
to Caesar, telling him that, what I have done, I did at their advice.

My dear Tullia's illness and weakness frightens me to death. I
understand you are taking great care of her, and I am very grateful.

I never had any doubt. For despair of his success had so completely
taken possession of the minds of all the kings and peoples, that I
thought this would happen to him, wherever he might go. I cannot help
feeling sorry for his fate, for I knew him to be a man of honour and
high moral principle. Am I to condole with you about Fannius? He used
to speak virulently of you for staying in Rome. L. Lentulus, you know,
had promised himself Hortensius' house, Caesar's gardens, and a place
at Baiae. Precisely the same is taking place on this side too, except
that on the other there was no limit. For they counted every one who
stayed in Italy as an enemy. But I would rather speak of this sometime
when I am less worried.

I hear my brother Quintus has set out for Asia to make his peace. About
his son I have heard nothing; but ask Diochares, Caesar's freedman, who
brought those letters from Alexandria. I have not seen him. He is said

Quamquam quid ego de lictoribus, qui paene ex Italia decedere sim
iussus? Nam ad me misit Antonius exemplum Caesaris ad se litterarum,
in quibus erat se audisse Catonem et L. Metellum in Italiam venisse,
Romae ut essent palam. Id sibi non placere, ne qui motus ex eo fierent;
prohiberique omnes Italia, nisi quorum ipse causam cognovisset;
deque eo vehementius erat scriptum. Itaque Antonius petebat a me per
litteras, ut sibi ignoscerem; facere se non posse, quin iis litteris
pareret. Tum ad eum misi L. Lamiam, qui demonstraret illum Dolabellae
dixisse, ut ad me scriberet, ut in Italiam quam primum venirem; eius
me litteris venisse. Tum ille edixit ita, ut me exciperet et Laelium
nominatim. Quod sane nollem; poterat enim sine nomine res ipsa excipi.

O multas et graves offensiones! quas quidem tu das operam ut lenias,
nec tamen nihil proficis, quin hoc ipso minuis dolorem meum, quod,
ut minuas, tam valde laboras; idque velim ne gravere quam saepissime
facere. Maxime autem adsequere, quod vis, si me adduxeris, ut existimem
me bonorum iudicium non funditus perdidisse. Quamquam quid tu in eo
potes? Nihil scilicet. Sed, si quid res dabit tibi facultatis, id me
maxima consolari poterit; quod nunc quidem

them as of their being assigned to him by Caesar himself. For I am told
he repudiates all the decrees of the Senate which were passed after the
departure of the tribunes. So, if he wants to be consistent, he will be
able to approve my lictors.

However, what is the use of talking about lictors, when I have almost
been ordered to leave Italy. For Antony has sent me a copy of a letter
from Caesar, in which he said he had heard that Cato and L. Metellus
had come to Italy and intended to live openly at Rome: that he did not
like, for fear it might cause some disturbance: and that none may enter
Italy, until he has himself investigated their case. He put the point
very strongly. So Antony wrote asking my pardon, and saying he could
not help obeying the letter. Then I sent L. Lamia to him to point out
that Caesar had told Dolabella to write and tell me to come to Italy as
soon as possible: and that it was on the strength of that letter that
I had come. Then Antony issued an edict excepting myself and Laelius
by name. I wish he had not done that: he might have made an exception
without mentioning names.

What a heap of troubles and how serious too! And you are doing your
best to make them lighter, and with some success--indeed that you try
so hard to relieve me is some relief in itself. I hope you won't find
it a burden to do so as often as possible. But you will succeed in your
object best, if you can convince me that I have not entirely lost the
good opinion of the loyal party. Yet what can you do in that matter?
Nothing of course. But, if anything gives a chance, that is what will
best console me. I see that at present it is impossible:

video non esse, sed, si quid ex eventis, ut hoc nunc accidit. Dicebar
debuisse cum Pompeio proficisci. Exitus illius minuit eius officii
praetermissi reprehensionem. Sed ex omnibus nihil magis tamem
desideratur, quam quod in Africam non ierim. Iudicio hoc sum usus, non
esse barbaris auxiliis fallacissimae gentis rem publicam defendendam,
praesertim contra exercitum saepe victorem, Non probant fortasse;
multos enim viros bonos in Africam venisse audio et scio fuisse antea.
Valde hoc loco urgeor. Hic quoque opus est casu, ut aliqui sint ex
eis, aut, si potest, omnes qui salutem anteponant. Nam, si perseverant
et obtinent, quid nobis futurum sit, vides. Dices: "Quid illis, si
victi erunt?" Honestior est plaga. Haec me excruciant. Sulpici autem
consilium non scripsisti cur meo non anteponeres. Quod etsi non tam
gloriosum est quam Catonis, tamen et periculo vacuum est et dolore.
Extremum est eorum, qui in Achaia sunt. Ei tamen ipsi se hoc melius
habent quam nos, quod et multi sunt uno in loco, et, cum in Italiam
venerint, domum statim venerint. Haec tu perge, ut facis, mitigare et
probare quam plurimis.

but if anything does turns up, as in this present case. It used to be
said that I ought to have gone with Pompey: but now his death tends to
absolve me from blame for neglecting my duty in that case. But where I
am thought to have been most lacking is in not going to Africa. My view
was that barbarian auxiliaries drawn from a most deceitful race were
not the proper persons to defend the State, especially against an army
which had won so many victories. That view may not meet with approval;
for I hear that many patriots have arrived in Africa, and I know there
were some there before. This is a point that really bothers me: and
here again I must trust to luck, that there may be some of them, or,
if such a thing is possible, all of them, who put safety first. For,
if they hold fast and succeed, you can see what a position I shall be
in. You will say "How about it, if they are defeated?" That is a more
honourable blow. This is what tortures me. However, you have not told
me why you do not prefer Sulpicius' policy to mine. It may not be so
glorious as Cato's: but it is at any rate free from danger and regret.
The last case is that of those who stayed in Achaia. Even they are in
a better position than I am, because there are many of them together,
and, when they do come to Italy, they will go straight home. Please
continue your efforts to ameliorate my position and to win over as many
people as possible to approval.

You explain why you do not come. Yes, I know your reasons and think it
is to my interest that you should stay where you are, for one thing
that you may be able to carry out any necessary negotiations about me
with the proper persons, as you have done.

And in the first place I should like to call your attention to this
point. I think there are many who have reported or will report to
Caesar either that I am repenting of my policy or that I do not approve
of recent events. Though both are true, they say it out of spite
against me, not because they have seen it to be so. Everything rests
on the support of Balbus and Oppius, and on their confirming Caesar's
good will to me by sending him frequent letters. Please do your best
to bring this about. The other reason why I prefer you not to leave is
that you say Tullia begs for your assistance. What a misfortune? What
can I say? What can I even wish? I will cut the matter short, for tears
spring to my eyes at once. I give you a free hand: do you look to it.
Only take care that nothing is done under the present circumstances to
offend the great man. I crave your pardon. Tears and sorrow prevent me
from dwelling any longer on this topic. I will only add that nothing
makes me feel more grateful to you than your love for her.

You are quite right to send letters for me to anyone to whom you think
it necessary. I have met a man who saw young Quintus at Samos and his
father at Sicyon. They will easily obtain their pardon. I only hope,
that, as they will see Caesar first, they will think fit to further my
case with him, as much as I should have furthered theirs, if I had been
able.

You ask me to take it in good part, if there is anything in your
letters that wounds my feelings. I promise you to take it in the best
possible part, and I beg you to write everything quite openly, as you
do, and to do so as often as possible. Farewell.

Though of course you see for yourself in what distress I am, you will
learn more about it from Lepta and Trebatius. I am paying very heavily
for my rashness, which you want to persuade me was prudence: and I
don't want to stop you arguing that it was and writing to me to that
effect as often as possible. For your letters afford me a good deal
of relief under the present circumstances. You must use your utmost
endeavour with those who are my supporters and have influence with
him--Balbus and Oppius especially--to make them write about me as
strongly as possible. For I hear that I am being attacked by some who
are with him, and also by letter. Their attack must be met, as the
importance of the matter demands. Fufius, a very bitter enemy of mine,
is there. Quintus sent his son not only to make peace for himself, but
to accuse me. He keeps saying that I am trying to set Caesar against
him, though Caesar and all his friends deny it. And he does not cease,
wherever he is, from heaping all sorts of abuse on me. It is the most
surprising thing that ever happened to me and the bitterest of all
my present sorrows. Those who reported the matter to me professed to
have heard it from his own lips, when he was slandering me at Sicyon
in the hearing of many. You know his way; indeed you may have had some
personal experience of it. Now it is all turned on me. But I increase
my own sorrow, and yours too, by speaking of it. So I return to my
first point. Take care that Balbus sends some one expressly

I have certainly acted incautiously, as you say, and more hastily than
I should; and I have no hope seeing that I am tied here by the special
clause in the edict. If that had not been inserted by your own kind
efforts, I might have gone to some lonely retreat. Now not even that is
open to me. How does it help me that I came before the tribunes entered
on office, when my coming at all does not help? And what have I now
to hope from a man who never was friendly with me, when my ruin and
humiliation is secured even by law? Balbus' letters to me are becoming
daily cooler, and it may be he receives dozens against me. My own fault
is my ruin. Fortune has brought no ills upon me: I have brought them
all on my own head. For when I saw what kind of war it was going to be,
one side unprepared and weak and the other thoroughly well prepared, I
had made my plan--not a very courageous plan perhaps, but one for which
there were special excuses in my case. I gave way to my relations, or
rather I obeyed them. What the real feelings of one of them were--the
one for whom you speak--you will know from the letters he has sent to
you and to others. I should never have opened them, had it not been
for the following circumstance. A packet was brought to me. I undid
it to see if there was any letter for me. There was none; but one for
Vatinius and another for Ligurius. Those I had

       *       *       *       *       *

                                Page 380

statim ardentes dolore venerunt scelus hominis clamantes; epistulas
mihi legerunt plenas omnium in me probrorum. Hic Ligurius furere. "Se
enim scire summo illum in odio fuisse Caesari. Illum tamen non modo
favisse, sed etiam tantam illi pecuniam dedisse honoris mei causa." Hoc
ego dolore accepto volui scire, quid scripsisset ad ceteros; ipsi enim
illi putavi perniciosum fore, si eius hoc tantum scelus percrebruisset.
Cognovi eiusdem generis. Ad te misi. Quas si putabis illi ipsi utile
esse reddi, reddes. Nil me laedet. Nam, quod resignatae sunt, habet,
opinor, eius signum Pomponia. Hac ille acerbitate initio navigationis
cum usus esset, tanto me dolore adfecit, ut postea iacuerim, neque nunc
tam pro se quam contra me laborare dicitur.

Ita omnibus rebus urgeor; quas sustinere vix possum vel plane nullo
modo possum. Quibus in miseriis una est pro omnibus, quod istam miseram
patrimonio, fortuna omni spoliatam relinquam. Quare te, ut polliceris,
videre plane velim. Alium enim, cui illam commendem, habeo neminem,
quoniam matri quoque eadem intellexi esse parata quae mihi. Sed, si me
non offendes, satis tamen habeto commendatam, patruumque in ea, quantum
poteris, mitigato.

Haec ad te die natali meo scripsi. Quo utinam susceptus non essem,
aut ne quid ex eadem matre postea natum esset! Plura scribere fletu
prohibeor.

sent to them. They came to me at once boiling with indignation and
crying shame on him, and they read me letters full of all kinds of
abuse of myself. Then Ligurius burst out with fury, "to his certain
knowledge Caesar detested Quintus and had favoured him and given him
all that money out of compliment to me." After this blow I wanted
to know what he had said to the others: for I thought it would be
disastrous to his own reputation if such a scandal got abroad. I found
they were all of a piece, and have sent them to you. If you think it
will do him any good to have them delivered, have them delivered. It
won't do me any harm. Though the seals are broken, I think Pomponia
has his signet. When, at the beginning of our voyage, he adopted this
bitter tone, I was so upset that I was prostrated afterwards; and now
he is said to be working against me rather than for himself.

So I am weighed down by such a heavy burden of griefs that I can hardly
bear up under it; indeed, I cannot possibly bear up under it. And among
all my miseries there is one that outweighs all the rest--that I shall
leave that poor girl[175] deprived of her patrimony and penniless.
So I hope you will fulfil your promise and look after her. I have no
one else to entrust her to, for I hear that her mother is threatened
with the same fate as myself. If you do not find me here, take this as
sufficient injunction as regards her, and soften her uncle towards her
as far as you can.

This I am writing on my birthday. Would that I had been left to die on

To my sorrows, which are incalculable, there has come an addition
in the news that is brought me about the two Quinti. My friend P.
Terentius was acting as deputy to the collector of port-dues and
pasture tax in Asia, and he saw young Quintus at Ephesus on the 8th
of December and gave him a cordial invitation on account of our
friendship. And when he asked him something about me, Quintus told
him that I was his deadliest enemy and showed him the manuscript of a
speech which he said he was going to deliver before Caesar against me.
Terentius said all he could to dissuade him from such folly. Afterwards
at Patrae the elder Quintus talked freely to him in the same scandalous
strain. What a rage he is in you will have inferred from the letters
I sent you. I am sure this will grieve you. To me it is positive
torture, especially as I don't expect I shall even have a chance of
expostulating with them.

The news I get about the state of affairs in Africa is quite different
to what you sent me. They say that all is as strong and as ready as
possible. Then there are Spain and Italy alienated from Caesar; his
legions are not what they were either in strength or in loyalty; and
in the city things are in a poor plight; I cannot get a moment's
peace except when I am reading your letters. They would certainly be
more frequent, if you had any news which you thought would lighten my
sorrows. Still I beg you not to neglect writing to me, whatever the
news may be; and, if you cannot bring yourself to hate those who have
shown such unfeeling hostility to me, at

especially as there is not even a gleam of hope for better days. So
hopeless am I that now I do not look forward even to your letters,
though they always bring me something I like to hear. So pray write,
whenever you have a messenger. I have no answer to give to your last
letter, though it is a long time since I received it, for I see no
change in the long interval: the right cause is strong, and I am paying
very heavily for my folly.

The £250[176] which I had from Cn. Sallustius are to be paid to P.
Sallustius. Please see that it is done without delay. I have written
to Terentia about it. And now it is nearly all spent: so I wish you
would arrange with her for some money for me to go on with. I shall
possibly be able to get some here, if I know I have a balance at Rome;
but, before I know that, I dare not try. You see the position of all
my affairs. There is no sort of misfortune which I am not enduring and
expecting. For this state of affairs

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.


[Sidenote: _Brundisium, March 8_, B.C. _47_]

Cephalio delivered a letter from you on the 8th of March in the
evening. Now on the morning of the same day I had sent messengers and
had given them a letter for you. But, when I read yours, I thought
I ought to send some answer, particularly because you show you are
in doubt as to what explanation I am going to offer Caesar of my
departure when I did depart from Italy. I have no necessity for a new
explanation, for I have often told him myself and instructed others
to tell him that I could not put up with people's talk, although I
wished it, and much else to the same effect. For there is nothing that
I should be more unwilling for him to imagine than that I did not make
up my own mind on so important a question. Afterwards I received a
letter from Cornelius Balbus the younger saying that Caesar thought my
brother Quintus had sounded the bugle for my departure (that was his
expression). I was not then aware of what Quintus had written about
me to many people; but, though he had spoken and acted with great
bitterness when face to face with me, none the less I wrote to Caesar
as follows:

"I am as much troubled about my brother Quintus as about myself; but
under the present circumstances I do not venture to recommend him to
you. One thing, however, I will venture to ask you--I

       *       *       *       *       *

abs te, quod te oro, ne quid existimes ab illo factum esse, quo minus
mea in te officia constarent, minusve te diligerem, potiusque semper
illum auctorem nostrae coniunctionis fuisse, meique itineris comitem,
non ducem. Quare ceteris in rebus tantum ei tribues, quantum humanitas
tua amicitiaque vestra postulat. Ego ei ne quid apud te obsim, id te
vehementer etiam atque etiam rogo."

Quare, si quis congressus fuerit mihi cum Caesare, etsi non dubito,
quin is lenis in illum futurus sit idque iam declaraverit, ego tamen is
ero, qui semper fui. Sed, ut video, multo magis est nobis laborandum de
Africa; quam quidem tu scribis confirmari cotidie magis ad condicionis
spem quam victoriae. Quod utinam ita esset! Sed longe aliter esse
intellego teque ipsum ita existimare arbitror, aliter autem scribere
non fallendi, sed confirmandi mei causa, praesertim cum adiungatur ad
Africam etiam Hispania.

Quod me admones, ut scribam ad Antonium et ad ceteros, si quid
videbitur tibi opus esse, velim facias id, quod saepe fecisti. Nihil
enim mihi venit in mentem, quod scribendum putem. Quod me audis
erectiorem esse animo, quid putas, cum videas accessisse ad superiores
aegritudines praeclaras generi

beseech you to acquit him of doing anything to disturb my sense of your
claims on me or to lessen my affection for you, and rather to regard
him as the main factor of our union and the companion, not the leader,
in my departure. And therefore in all other matters you will give
him all the credit that your own kindness and your mutual friendship
demands. What I earnestly beg you again and again is, that you will not
let me stand in his light with you."

So, if I ever do meet Caesar, though I have no doubt that he will be
lenient to Quintus and that he has already made that plain, I shall
behave as I always have behaved. But, as I see, what I ought to be
most anxious about is Africa, which you say is daily growing stronger,
though only to the extent of raising hopes of a compromise rather
than a victory. If it could only be true! But I read the signs quite
differently, and I think you agree with me, and only say the contrary
to hearten me, not to deceive me, especially as Spain too has now
joined Africa.[177]

[177] After his victory in Spain in 49 B.C., Caesar left Q. Cassius
Longinus in command there; but Spain went over to Pompey and both
Longinus and his successor, C. Trebonius, were driven out.

You advise me to write to Antony and others. If you think it necessary,
please do it for me, as you have often done before; for I cannot think
of anything worth writing. You hear I am less broken-spirited; but can
you believe it, when you see that to my former troubles are now added
my son-in-law's fine doings?[178] However, pray do not cease

A Murenae liberto nihil adhuc acceperam litterarum. P. Siser reddiderat
eas, quibus rescribo. De Servi patris litteris quod scribis, item
Quintum in Syriam venisse quod ais esse qui nuntient, ne id quidem
verum est. Quod certiorem te vis fieri, quo quisque in me animo sit aut
fuerit eorum, qui huc venerunt, neminem alieno intellexi. Sed, quantum
id mea intersit, existimare te posse certo scio. Mihi cum omnia sint
intolerabilia ad dolorem, tum maxime quod in eam causam venisse me
video, ut sola utilia mihi esse videantur, quae semper nolui.

P. Lentulum patrem Rhodi esse aiunt, Alexandreae filium, Rhodoque
Alexandream C. Cassium profectum esse constat. Quintus mihi per
litteras satis facit multo asperioribus verbis, quam cum gravissime

doing what you can to hearten me, that is writing to me, even if you
have nothing to say. For a letter from you always brings me something.

I have accepted Galeo's legacy. I suppose it only required a simple
form of acceptance,[179] since none was sent to me.

acceptance were laid down in the will.

I have not received any letter from Murena's freedman as yet. It was P.
Siser who delivered the one I am answering. You speak of a letter from
Servius' father, and you tell me some say that Quintus has landed in
Syria: neither is true. You want to be informed how those who have come
here feel or felt towards me. I have not found any ill-disposed: but,
how important that is to me, I am sure you can imagine. To me the whole
state of affairs is insufferably painful; and most of all that I have
got myself into such a case, that the only things that can be of any
use to me are precisely what I have always wished not to happen.

They say the elder P. Lentulus is at Rhodes, the younger at Alexandria,
and it is certain that C. Cassius has left Rhodes for Alexandria.
Quintus has written to apologize to me in terms much more irritating
than when he was abusing me most violently. For he says that he
understands from your letter that you were annoyed with him for writing

esse oppressum videret. Atque utinam vel nocturnis, quem ad modum tu
scripseras, itineribus propius te accessissem! Nunc, nec ubi nec quando
te sim visurus, possum suspicari.

De coheredibus Fufidianis nihil fuit quod ad me scriberes; nam et
aequum postulant, et, quicquid egisses, recte esse actum putarem. De
fundo Frusinati redimendo iam pridem intellexisti voluntatem meam.
Etsi tum meliore loco res erant nostrae neque tam mihi desperatum
iri videbantur, tamen in eadem sum voluntate. Id quem ad modum fiat,
tu videbis. Et velim, quod poteris, consideres, ut sit, unde nobis
suppeditentur sumptus necessarii. Si quas habuimus facultates, eas
Pompeio tum, cum id videbamur sapienter facere, detulimus. Itaque
tum et a tuo vilico sumpsimus et aliunde mutuati sumus; nunc Quintus
queritur per litteras sibi nos nihil dedisse, qui neque ab illo rogati
sumus neque ipsi eam pecuniam aspeximus. Sed velim videas, quid sit,
quod confici possit, quidque mihi de omnibus des consilii; et causam

harshly about me to many people, and so he is sorry that he hurt
your feelings: but he was right in what he did. Then he explains
with the greatest coarseness why he did it. But he would never have
shown his hatred for me either now or before, if he had not seen that
everything was against me. How I wish I had got nearer to you, even by
night-journeys as you suggested. Now I cannot conceive where or when I
shall see you.

As to my co-heirs in Fufidius' property, there was no reason for you
to write to me: for their demand is quite just, and anything you did
I should think right. As to the repurchase of the estate at Frusino,
you know already what I wish. Though my affairs were then in a better
position, and I did not expect to be in such desperate straits, still
my mind has not altered. How it is to be done, you will arrange. And
please consider to the best of your ability some way of obtaining ready
money for current expenses. All the money I had I handed over to Pompey
at a time when it seemed advisable to do so. So then I took money from
your steward and borrowed from others, and now Quintus complains by
letter that I did not give him a penny, when he never asked for it
and I never set eyes on the money myself. But please see what can be
managed and what advice you have to give me on all points: you know all
about it.

Grief prevents me from writing more. If there is anything you think
should be written to anyone in my name, please do so as usual; and as
often as you have anyone to whom you can give a letter to me, don't
forget it. Farewell.

I am not offended with you for telling me the truth in your letter and
not even attempting, as you were wont, to console me under my burden
of public and personal woes, which you confess is impossible now. For
affairs are no longer in the position they were, when, if nothing else,
I thought I had companions and partners in my policy. For all those
in Achaia and in Asia, who petitioned for pardon and did not obtain
it, and even some of those who did, are said to be on the point of
sailing for Africa. So I have no one to share my fault except Laelius,
and even he is in a better position than I am in one respect, as he
has been taken back now.[180] But about me I have no doubt that Caesar
has written to Balbus and Oppius: if the news had been good, I should
have heard from them and they would have spoken to you too. I should
like you to speak to them about it and to let me know what they say,
not that any safeguard given by him can have any certainty, but still
something can be foreseen and provided for. Though I am ashamed to look
anyone in the face, especially with such a son-in-law, still in this
disastrous crisis I see nothing else to wish for. Quintus is still
keeping on, as both Pansa and Hirtius have written to tell me; and he
is said too to be making for Africa with the rest. I will write to
Minucius at Tarentum, and send your letter: I will let you know whether
anything comes of it. I should have been surprised that

Since you give good reasons why I cannot see you at the present time,
pray consider what I am to do. For although Caesar holds Alexandria, he
seems to be ashamed even to send a dispatch about it, while the others
are apparently on the eve of coming here from Africa, and those in
Achaia too are either going to return from Asia to join them or they
are going to stop in some neutral place. So what do you think I am to
do? I see advice is difficult. For I am the one and only person--except
perhaps one other, who cannot return to the one party and who has no
hope at all offered him from the other. Still I should like to know
what you think: and that was one reason, among others, why I should
have liked to see you, if it were possible.

I told you before that Minucius has only paid £100.[184] Please see
that the rest is provided. Quintus in his letter instead of an earnest
appeal used the most bitter language, and his son showed extraordinary
animosity. There is no conceivable ill

potest mali, quo non urgear. Omnia tamen sunt faciliora quam peccati
dolor, qui et maximus est et aeternus. Cuius peccati si socios essem

habet aliorum omnium ratio exitum, mea nullum. Alii capti, alii
interclusi non veniunt in dubium de voluntate, eo minus scilicet, cum

ad Fufium venerunt, nihil possunt nisi timidi existimari. Multi autem
sunt, qui, quocumque modo ad illos se recipere volent, recipientur.
Quo minus debes mirari non posse me tanto dolori resistere. Solius
enim meum peccatum corrigi non potest et fortasse Laeli. Sed quid me
id levat? Nam C. quidem Cassium aiunt consilium Alexandream eundi
mutavisse.

with which I am not oppressed. But all of them are lighter to bear than
my sense of guilt: that is overwhelming and enduring. If I were to have
those, whom I thought I had, to share that guilt, that would still be
some consolation, though a poor one. But every one else's case admits
of some way out, mine of none. Some were captured, some cut off, so
there is no doubt about their intentions, especially since they have
extricated themselves and joined forces again. Nay even those, who of
their own free will came to Fufius,[186] can only be thought cowards.
But there are many who will be taken back, however they choose to take
themselves back to the fold. So you ought not to be surprised that I
cannot bear up against all my sorrow. For I am the one and only person
whose slip cannot be mended, except perhaps Laelius--and what good is
that?--for they say even C. Cassius has changed his mind about going to
Alexandria.

wanting to make me the most miserable of men. But I return to the first

cannot.

Why could nothing be settled about Fufidius' estate? For the
arrangement was one about which there is generally no dispute, since
the share, which seems smaller, can be made up by the proceeds of the
sale.[188] I have a reason for asking. For I suspect my co-heirs think
my case is doubtful, and so prefer to keep the matter open. Farewell.

It is not my fault at the present time (for I did commit an error
before) that the letter you send[189] does not give me any consolation.
For it is grudgingly written, and raises great suspicion that it is
not by Caesar: I expect you noticed that too. About going to meet him
I will do as you advise. For no one thinks he is coming, and those who
come from Asia say there has been no word of peace: and it was hope of
a peace that led me into this error.

[189] A letter purporting to come from Caesar, but later found to be a
forgery.

I see nothing to make me think of hope, especially now that that blow
has fallen in Asia, in Illyricum, in the Cassian affair, in Alexandria
itself, in Rome and in Italy.[190] For my part, even if he is on his
return--whereas

[190] Cicero alludes to the defeat of Domitius Calvinus in Asia, the
failure of Aulus Gabinius in Illyricum, the insurrection of Baetica,
which forced Cassius to leave the province, Caesar's difficulties at
Alexandria, the riots in Rome, and the mutinous state of the army in
Italy.

puto.

Quod autem scribis quandam laetitiam bonorum esse commotam, ut sit
auditum de litteris, tu quidem nihil praetermittis in quo putes
aliquid solacii esse, sed ego non adducor quemquam bonum ullam salutem
putare mihi tanti fuisse, ut eam peterem ab illo, et eo minus, quod
huius consilii iam ne socium quidem habeo quemquam. Qui in Asia sunt,
rerum exitum exspectant, Achaici etiam Fufio spem deprecationis
afferunt. Horum et timor idem fuit primo qui meus et constitutum; mora
Alexandrina causam illorum correxit, meam evertit. Quam ob rem idem a

dispiceres, quod mihi putares faciendum, me moneres. Si recipior ab
his, quod vides non fieri, tamen, quoad bellum erit, quid agam aut ubi
sim, non reperio; sin iactor, eo minus. Itaque tuas litteras exspecto,
easque ut ad me sine dubitatione scribas, rogo.

Quod suades, ut ad Quintum scribam de his litteris, facerem, si me
quicquam istae litterae delectarent. Etsi quidam scripsit ad me his
verbis: "Ego ut in his malis Patris sum non invitus; essem libentius,

he is said to be still fighting--still I think the business will be
settled before he does return.

You say, however, that some feeling of pleasure was aroused among the
loyalists when they heard of this letter. Of course you do not omit
anything in which you think there is the least consolation, but I
cannot bring myself to believe that any of the loyalists supposed that
I prize any salvation highly enough to beg for it of him: especially as
I have not even a single partner in this policy now. Those who are in
Asia are waiting to see how things turn out: those in Achaia too keep
holding out to Fufius the hope that they will petition for pardon. They
at first had the same fear and the same plan as myself; but the hitch
at Alexandria improved their case and ruined mine. So I still make the
same request of you as in former letters: if in these desperate straits
you see anything you think I ought to do, tell me of it. If I am taken
back by the loyalists, which you see is not the case, still, so long as
the war lasts, I don't see what I am to do or where I am to stay; still
less, if I am rejected by them. So I await a letter from you, and I beg
you to write to me without hesitation.

You advise me to write to Quintus about this letter. I would, if the
letter gave me any pleasure, though some one has written to me saying:
"Considering the evil days, I am pretty comfortable at Patrae, and I
should be more so, if your brother would speak of you as I should like
to hear him."

As to his writing to you to say that I don't answer any of his letters,
I've only had one from him. To that I gave an answer to Cephalio, but
he was delayed many months by storms. I have already mentioned that
young Quintus has written to me most bitterly.

The last thing I have to ask you is, that, if you think it right
and care to undertake it, you and Camillus together should advise
Terentia to make her will. Circumstances suggest that she ought to make
provision for satisfying her creditors. I hear from Philotimus that she
is doing some underhand things. I can hardly believe it; but anyhow, if
there is anything of the kind (and there possibly may be), it ought to
be guarded against. Please write to me about everything, and especially
what you think about her. I want your advice about her, even if you
cannot think of any plan: for in that case I shall take it the case is

send my own. Tullia came to me on the 12th of June and told me of all

I am thinking of sending my son with Sallustius to Caesar. As for
Tullia, I see no reason for keeping her with me any longer when both of
us are in such sorrow: so I am going to send her back to her mother, as
soon as she herself will allow me. In return for the letter which you
wrote in a consolatory style, please consider that I have made the only
answer, which, as you yourself know, was possible.

You tell me Oppius has had a talk with you: and what you say agrees
well enough with my suspicions of him. But I feel sure that party[191]
can never be convinced that their actions can possibly win my approval,
whatever I may say. However, I will be as moderate as I can: though,
what difference it makes to me, if I do incur their enmity, I cannot
conceive.

I see you have a good reason for not being able to come to me: and
I am very sorry that is so. There is no news that Caesar has left
Alexandria; and it is well known that no one at all has left that place
since the 15th of March, and that he has despatched no letters since
the 13th of December. So you see it was quite untrue about the letter

There is no rumour of his leaving Alexandria as yet: on the contrary,
he is thought to be in great difficulties. So I am not sending my son,
as I had arranged, and I beseech you to get me away from here: for any
punishment is lighter to bear than staying here. On this point I have
written to Antony, to Balbus and to Oppius. For whether there is going
to be a war in Italy, or whether he will employ his fleet--and it may
be either, but one it must be--this is a most inappropriate place for
me. I understood of course from what Oppius said according to your
letter, how angry they are with me: but I beg you to turn their anger.
I don't expect anything now that is not unpleasant: but my present
condition is as desperate as anything can be. So please speak with
Antony and the Caesarians, and see the matter through for me as best
you can: and let me have an answer on all points as soon as possible.

Antioch in Caesar's train with Hirtius. They had got what they wanted
about my brother without any difficulty at all. I should feel more
joy at that, if what I have got myself gave me some sure ground for
hope.[193] But there are things

I have to fear from the Quinti and others: and Caesar's own regal
concessions are again in his own power to revoke. He has even pardoned
Sallustius. Indeed he is said not to deny anyone, and that in itself
arouses a suspicion that he is only deferring investigation. M.
Gallius, son of Quintus, has given back his slaves to Sallustius. He
came to transport the legions to Sicily, and he says Caesar is going

Caesar probably won't reach Athens by the 1st of September. There are
said to be many things that keep him in Asia, especially Pharnaces.
The 12th legion, which Sulla visited first, is said to have driven
him off with stones, and it is thought none of them will stir. Caesar
it is supposed will go straight from Patrae to Sicily. But, if so, he
must come here. I should have preferred him to go straight there, for I
should have got away from here somehow. Now I am afraid I must wait for
him, and in addition to other afflictions my poor daughter must endure
this unhealthy climate.

You advise me to make my actions fit the times. I would, if
circumstances permitted, and it were anyhow possible. But what with
all my own mistakes and the wrongs inflicted on me by my family, there
is nothing worthy of myself that I can do or even pretend to do. You
compare Sulla's reign: that in principle was all that could be noble,
but it was rather too lacking in moderation. The present crisis however
is such that I forget myself, and should much prefer the public cause
to win rather than that with which my interests are bound up. However,
please write to me as often as possible, especially as no one else
writes, and, if all the world were writing, I should still look forward
to your letters more than any. You say Caesar will be kinder to Quintus
for my sake: but I told you before he had made every concession to
young Quintus, without mentioning me. Farewell.

Sulla, ut opinor, cras erit hic cum Messalla. Currunt ad illum pulsi a
militibus, qui se negant usquam, nisi acceperint. Ergo ille huc veniet,
quod non putabant, tarde quidem. Itinera enim ita facit, ut multos
dies in oppido uno[195] ponat. Pharnaces autem, quoquo modo aget,
adferet moram. Quid mihi igitur censes? Iam enim corpore vix sustineo
gravitatem huius caeli, quae mihi laborem adfert in dolore. An his
illuc euntibus mandem, ut me excusent, ipse accedam propius? Quaeso,

Balbus' letter-carrier delivered the packet quite promptly. For I have
got a letter from you in which you seem to doubt whether I received
those letters. I wish they had never been delivered: for they increased
my sorrow, and, if they had fallen into anyone's hands, they would
not have told them anything new. For his hatred of me and the kind of
letters he writes are common knowledge. Even Caesar, when he sent them
to your friends, seems to have done it, not to show his annoyance at
Quintus' disgraceful conduct, but, I suppose, to make my misfortunes
better known. You say you are afraid they may do Quintus some harm, and
you are trying to remedy it. Why, Caesar did not even wait to be asked
about him. That does not annoy me: what is more annoying is that the
favours granted to me have no sterling value.

Sulla, I believe, will be here to-morrow with Messalla. They are
hurrying to him, hounded away by the soldiers, who refuse to go
anywhere, until they get their pay. So, though people thought he would
not, he will be coming here; but not in a hurry. For he is travelling
slowly, and he is stopping many days in each town. Then, however he
manages things, Pharnaces must delay him. So what do you think about
me? For already I am scarcely capable physically of bearing this bad
climate, which adds ill-health to my troubles. Shall I commission these
people, who are going to him, to make my excuses, and come nearer Rome?
Please give the point your

Camillus has written to me saying that you have spoken to him on the
subject about which I suggested you should consult with him. Now I
am expecting a letter from you: only I don't see how the thing is to
be changed, if it is not as it ought to be. But, when I got a letter
from him, I looked for one from you, though I suppose you did not know
the post was going. I only hope you are well: for you said you had an
attack of some kind of illness.

A man of the name of Agusius came from Rhodes on the 8th of July.
He tells me young Quintus set out to go to Caesar on May 29th, and
Philotimus arrived at Rhodes the day before with a letter for me. You
will hear Agusius himself: but he is travelling rather slowly. So I
arranged to give this to some one who was going more quickly. What
there is in that letter, I don't know, but my brother Quintus offers
me hearty congratulations. For my part after my great mistake I cannot
even imagine anything that can possibly be endurable to me. I beg you

think of my poor girl, both as regards the point about which I wrote
lately--making some arrangement to avoid destitution--and also as
regards the will itself. The other thing too I wish I had attended
to before; but I was afraid of everything. In this very bad business
there was nothing better than a divorce. I should have done something
like a man, either on the score of his cancelling of debts or his
night attacks on houses, or Metella or all his sins together: I should
not have lost the money, and I should have shown some manly spirit. I
remember of course your letter, but I remember the circumstances too:
still anything would have been better than this. Now he seems to be
giving notice of divorce himself; for I have heard about the statue of
Clodius. To think that a son-in-law of mine above all people should do
such a thing as that, or abolish debts! So I agree with you we must
serve a notice of divorce on him. Perhaps he will ask for the third
instalment of the dowry. So consider whether we should wait for a move
of his or act first.[196] If I can possibly manage it, even by night
journeys, I will try to see you. Please write to me about this and
anything else it may interest me to know. Farewell.

[196] If Dolabella started the divorce proceedings, he could not claim
the rest of the dowry, and would have to refund what had already been
paid. If Tullia began them, part at least of the dowry would remain
with him, unless she could prove misconduct.

Quae dudum ad me et (quae etiam ad me vis) ad Tulliam de me scripsisti,

quod mihi non modo irasci gravissima iniuria accepta, sed ne dolere
quidem impune licet. Quare istuc feramus. Quod cum tulerimus, tamen

[Sidenote: _Brundisium, Aug. 6_, B.C. _47_]

What you wrote to me some time ago and to Tullia too about me, with
the intention that it should be passed on to me, I feel to be true.
It adds to my misery, though I thought nothing could be added, that,
when I have received the deepest injury, I cannot show anger or even
annoyance with impunity. So I must put up with that. And when I have
borne that blow, I shall still have to suffer what you warn me to guard
against. For I have got myself into such trouble, that, whatever the
state of affairs or the feelings of the people may be, the result for
me apparently will be the same.

But here I take the pen myself; for I shall have to deal with
confidential matters. Please see to the will even now, as it was made
when she had begun to get into difficulties. She did not bother you, I
think; for she did not even ask me about it. But, supposing that is so,
since you have broached the subject already, you will be able to advise
her to deposit it with some one whose position is not affected by this
war. Myself I would rather you were the person, if she agrees to that.
The fact is I am keeping the poor woman in the dark as to that fear of
mine.[197]

[197] That her property would be confiscated.

For that other matter, I know of course that nothing can be put up for
sale now, but things could be put away and hidden, so that they escape
the crash which is threatening. For, when you

et tua Tulliae fore parata, tua credo, nostra quae poterunt esse? De
Terentia autem (mitto cetera, quae sunt innumerabilia) quid ad hoc
addi potest? Scripseras, ut HS X̅I̅I̅ permutaret; tantum esse reliquum
de argento. Misit illa CCIↃↃ mihi et adscripsit tantum esse reliquum.
Cum hoc tam parvum de parvo detraxerit, perspicis, quid in maxima re
fecerit.

Philotimus non modo nullus venit, sed ne per litteras quidem aut per
nuntium certiorem facit me, quid egerit. Epheso qui veniunt, ibi se eum
de suis controversiis in ius adeuntem vidisse nuntiant; quae quidem
(ita enim veri simile est) in adventum Caesaris fortasse reiciuntur.
Ita aut nihil puto eum habere, quod putet ad me celerius perferendum,
aut adeo me in malis esse despectum, ut, etiamsi quid habet, id nisi
omnibus suis negotiis confectis ad me referre non curet. Ex quo magnum
equidem capio dolorem, sed non tantum, quantum videor debere. Nihil
enim mea minus interesse puto, quam quid illinc adferatur. Id quam ob
rem, te intellegere certo scio.

Quod me mones de vultu et oratione ad tempus accommodanda, etsi
difficile est, tamen imperarem mihi, a mea quicquam interesse putarem.
Quod scribis litteris putare te Africanum negotium confici posse,
vellem scriberes, cur ita putares; mihi quidem nihil in mentem venit,
quare id putem fieri posse. Tu tamen velim, si quid erit, quod
consolationis aliquid

write that my fortune and yours are at Tullia's service, I believe you
as to yours, but what can there be of mine? Now as to Terentia, I omit
lots of other things, for what can one add to this? You wrote to her
to remit me by bill of exchange £100, saying that was the balance. She
sent me 80 guineas,[198] adding that that was all the balance. If she
purloins so trifling an amount from so small a total, you can see what
she has been doing in the case of larger sums.

[198] 12,000 and 10,000 sesterces respectively.

Not a trace of Philotimus as yet: nay, he has not even informed me by
letter or messenger what he has done. Those who come from Ephesus say
they saw him there going into court about some lawsuits of his own,
which possibly--indeed in all probability--are deferred till Caesar's
arrival. So I suppose he either has nothing which he thinks he need
hurry to bring to me, or I have sunk so low in my misfortunes that,
even if he has, he does not take the trouble to bring it until he
has finished all his own business. And that causes me considerable
annoyance, but not so much as I think it ought. For I don't think
anything matters much less to me than what answer he brings back from
that quarter. Why, I am quite sure you know.

You advise me to mould my looks and words according to circumstances.
It is difficult, but I would put a rein on myself, if I thought it
mattered to me at all. You say you think the African business can be
arranged by an interchange of letters: I wish you would say, why you
think so: for I can't imagine any reason for thinking it possible.
However please write to me, if there is anything that would give me

I can quite believe what you explain at some length in your letter,
that no advice of yours can assist me: and certainly there is no
consolation which can relieve my sorrow. For none of my misfortunes
has come upon me by fate--that would have been endurable--but I
have brought all on myself by my mistakes and my mental and bodily
afflictions, which I only wish my nearest and dearest had thought
fit to remedy. So, as there is no hope of any advice from you or any
consolation, I will not ask for them henceforth: only please do not
cease from writing to me anything that may occur to you, when you have
anyone to send it by, and so long as there is anyone to send it to;
which will not be long.

There is a rumour, though not a very certain one, that Caesar has left
Alexandria. It came first from a letter of Sulpicius, and has been
confirmed by all subsequent messengers. Whether to prefer it to be
false or true, I don't know, as it does not matter to me.

As I told you already about the will I should like it to be preserved
in a safe place.[200] I am worn out and harassed by the infatuation of
my unhappy daughter. I don't think there ever was such a child

[200] This seems to be the sense, though the reading is doubtful.

of misfortune. If I can do anything for her in any way, I wish you

there was before in giving me advice: but this causes me more anxiety
than anything. It was blind of me to pay the second instalment. I wish
I had not: but that is over and done with. I beg you to do your best,
as it is in the last extremity, to collect and get together what you
can from the sale of plate and furniture, of which there is a good
deal, and put it in a safe place. For now I think the end is near,
there will be no peace negotiations, and the present government will
collapse even without an adversary. As to this speak to Terentia too at
your convenience, if you think fit. I cannot write everything. Farewell.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
